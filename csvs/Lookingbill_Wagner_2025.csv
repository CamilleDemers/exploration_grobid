Although sexual assault is associated with significant negative psychological health outcomes, few survivors seek support from formal providers. This study explored the barriers to accessing and benefitting from services for sexual assault, as disclosed in narrative posts on social media, using qualitative methodology. Of the 1,179 narratives posted to the subreddit'r/rapecounseling' that were reviewed, 81 data extracts from 52 women were included in this study based on predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Six themes were identified that prevented survivors from accessing or benefitting from help. Internal barriers included feeling overwhelmed and avoidance-based coping. External barriers included availability of services, suitability of services, and therapist-caused harms. Stigma was the only barrier that was experienced both internally and externally. These findings suggest a need for more supportive mental health services.

2006), lesbian, bisexual (Gilmore, Koo, Nguyen, Granato, Hughes, & Kaysen, 2014), transgender (Hoxmeier, 2016), living with disabilities (Martin et al., 2006), and working in the sex industry (O'Doherty, 2011).
Victimization is associated with significant, often chronic, mental and physical health outcomes (Black et al., 2011;Du Mont & White, 2007). Anger, anxiety, guilt, shame, depression, humiliation, numbness, isolation, and low self-esteem are common emotional responses (Acierno, Brady, Gray, Kilpatrick, Resnick, & Best, 2002;Barglow, 2014;Chivers-Wilson, 2006;Moors & Webber, 2012). In some individuals, distress leads to clinical diagnoses, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression (Campbell, Dworkin, & Cabral, 2009;De Choudhary, Smith, & Bassarte, 2012). In addition, survivors are more likely than women with no history of victimization to experience physical complaints, such as irritable bowel syndrome, headaches, chronic pain, poor sleep, asthma, and diabetes (Black et al., 2011). Furthermore, trauma resulting from sexual assault can disrupt employment, or lead to the inability to work, resulting in the degradation of economic well-being in survivors over time (Loya, 2015).
Formal health and social service providers can address the negative physical consequences of sexual assault, reduce distress (Campbell, 2006;Kennedy et al., 2012), and provide a gateway to further supports (Lanthier, Du Mont, & Mason, 2016;World Health Organization, 2013). Despite the alarming prevalence of sexual assault, few women seek help from formal service providers due to significant barriers to disclosure (Kennedy et al., 2012;Patterson, Greeson, & Campbell, 2009). A growing body of evidence suggests that stereotypical expectations about sexual assault, or rape myths, may play an important role in survivors' service utilization (Patterson et al., 2009). Rape myths depict sexual assault as, ""an act of violent, forceful penetration committed by a stranger during a blitz attack in a public deserted place"" (Du Mont, Miller, & Myhr, 2003, p. 469) and the survivor, typically, ""as a morally upright White woman who is physically injured while resisting"" (Du Mont et al., 2003, p. 469). Individuals whose experiences fail to conform to these stereotypes may experience uncertainty about whether the assault ""qualifies"" as rape, thus preventing help-seeking (Du Mont et al., 2003).
In addition, survivors whose experiences deviate from stereotypical notions of what is a ""real"" rape and who is a ""real"" victim can encounter stigmatizing responses from service providers (Ahrens, Campbell, Ternier-Thames, Wasco, & Sefl, 2007;Carretta, Burgess, & DeMarco, 2016;Patterson et al., 2009). Indeed, many survivors report blame and disbelief from formal service providers, especially from medical and criminal justice personnel (Lanthier et al., 2016), as well as responses that are described as minimizing, dismissing, cold, detached, contemptuous, and/or pitying (Lanthier et al., 2016). Hurtful responses such as these can be barriers to getting the help needed and, moreover, can lead to secondary victimization, potentially worsening PTSD and other symptoms (Campbell, 2008;Patterson et al., 2009). The interplay of sociocultural beliefs that stigmatize survivors, and evidence suggesting that negative stereotypes are enacted in face-to-face settings between service providers and survivors, indicates that investigations of sexual assault disclosure must account for intersecting socioecological and individual factors that shape whether disclosure occurs, and whether survivors experience benefit from disclosure (Allagia, Collin-Vezina, & Lateef, 2017).
Given the potential challenges associated with seeking help from formal service providers, some survivors turn to peer-to-peer community websites and social media sites in particular, to look for support (Barak, Boniel-Nissim, & Suler, 2008;Choudhury & De, 2014;Fawcett & Shesthra, 2016). One such social media website, reddit.com (reddit), Pdf_Folio:127 allows anonymous text and media posts, with content organized topically within ""subreddits."" Individuals can upload their own or comment on others' posts and as such, reddit functions as a forum (Choudhury & De, 2014). Social media websites such as reddit, enable user anonymity, which can increase information sharing and interpersonal support on stigmatized topics (Barak et al., 2008;Brennan, Swartout, Cook, & Parrott, 2016). To explore survivors' accounts of barriers that they experienced in getting appropriate help, we examined one relevant subreddit on the topic of sexual assault. Fuller understanding of barriers experienced by survivors could aid in the identification of effective strategies for increasing access to timely and effective social and healthcare services. In addition, the findings could be helpful in identifying future research directions, program planning, and advocacy interventions for survivors.
METHOD
This research was formally reviewed by institutional authorities at Women's College Hospital and was deemed not to require Research Ethics Board approval.
Data Source
This qualitative content analysis used narratives collected from reddit.com to gain insight into the barriers redditors experienced in getting help post sexual assault. In the current study, ""narratives"" refers to content shared on reddit and ""redditors""refers to individuals who submit posts to the site. We collected narratives from the subreddit, ""r/rapecounseling,"" a subreddit that is used by participants to share experiences of sexual assault and provide emotional support to one another.
Data Collection
Narratives were collected between October 26, 2014and July 31, 2015and November 1, 2016and February 28, 2017. After the first period of data collection, two researchers reviewed the narratives and agreed that there were insufficient references to help-seeking to support in-depth analysis. This led to the second period of data collection. In total, 1,179 narratives were reviewed for their inclusion of content on seeking and receiving help from social service and healthcare providers. Exclusion criteria included narratives by males, family members or friends, and posts focused on abusive experiences exclusive to childhood. Comments made in response to narratives were also excluded. After applying exclusion criteria, there were 161 narratives that focused on experiences of seeking and receiving help.
These 161 narratives were entered into a data management program, NVivo11 (QSR, 2010) to assist with managing the analysis. Narratives that described barriers to getting appropriate help were extracted for further review and coding, resulting in 52 narratives from unique redditors. Multiple codes could be applied to a single narrative, resulting in a final sample of 81 data text extracts.
Data Analysis
We followed analytic procedures for qualitative research (Braun & Clarke, 2006; see also Hsieh & Shannon, 2005;Morse & Field, 1995) to identify and report patterns across the Pdf_Folio:128 data extracts. Members of the research team immersed themselves in the data, repeatedly reading the data extracts. The research team members actively reflected on their subjective positions vis a vis the data and throughout the ensuing coding process, practiced reflexivity by challenging their own and each other's assumptions. All team members participated in the analytic process.
In step one of the analysis, the research team independently read survivors' narratives of barriers to getting help. After the research team had gained familiarity with the data extracts, in step two of the analysis, they met and generated a set of initial, descriptive codes based on this reading (e.g., ""having to wait to receive service,"" ""limited access to services,"" ""unsuitability of help,"" ""financial limitations,"" ""self-blame and guilt,"" and ""rape myths""). In step three, over a series of meetings the research team compared and discussed these initial codes and reviewed all of the coded text. Following discussion, some of the coded texts were split into separate codes, others were collapsed, renamed, or received multiple codes.
In step four, agreement on an initial set of candidate themes was reached. Candidate themes included codes with shared meanings. For example, codes that referred to barriers due to the geographic distance to services and prohibitive costs were grouped within a candidate theme ""availability of services."" In another example, the candidate theme initially named, ""suitability of services"" was split to highlight references to help that were perceived as harmful. The new candidate theme ""therapist-caused harms"" was created to account for the specific instances in which help was not just unsuitable but actually considered to have been overtly harmful.
In step five, the research team first independently reexamined the candidate themes (often returning to the original narratives), and then over a series of meetings, discussed the broader significance and concepts embedded within these candidate themes. The candidate themes were resorted, sometimes combined, and finally revised into final themes, the broad patterns of meaning emergent from the data analysis process (Braun & Clarke, 2006). For example, reexamining the candidate themes described above resulted in combining ""self-blame and guilt"" with ""rape myths"" to become part of the theme called, ""stigma."" Within this theme, two subthemes were identified ""intrapsychic stigma"" and ""sociocultural stigma."" All decisions were arrived at by consensus.
RESULTS
Six themes were identified that reflected both internal and external barriers to accessing help from health and social service providers, and then benefitting from help once received. Two themes referred to internal barriers: feeling overwhelmed, and avoidance-based coping. Three themes referenced external barriers to accessing and benefitting from help: availability of services, suitability of services, and therapist-caused harms. One theme, stigma, was identified as both an internal and external barrier. Of interest, 26 (50%) redditors in the current study reported disclosing sexual assault for the first time online.
Internal Barriers
Feeling Overwhelmed. Feeling psychologically or physiologically overwhelmed prevented some survivors from seeking assistance. Situational factors, such as childcare and work responsibilities, often contributed to these feelings. Nine data extracts reflected this theme. Pdf_Folio:129  Redditor 37 referred to her situation as a ""Pandora's Box,"" depicting it as something uncontainable that risked hijacking her entire life. Yet despite the enormity of the challenges she faced internally, her life circumstances prevented her from accessing needed services, or even having time to rest. She wrote:
But now what? I am failing. I can't breathe. I don't know what I'm doing, or who I am. I have these mini breakdowns a hundred times a day. No one knows, my family is pushing me back to him. My children simply see me frozen. Or overwhelmed. I cried at work the other day. I have put so much so far down deep that I can't deal with it. I can't even make the little decisions lately, how can I try and deal with the big thing . . . If I can't even grocery shop or do the dishes or function day to day with it in its box in my head . . . How? How do I begin to start without it becoming Pandora's Box? I don't have time for counseling right now. I run from 6.30-10.30 without a break. Without a breath. It's too much to think about pulling it out. I can't risk losing it completely. I barely have it together as it is.
Further to this, some redditors reported coping with high levels of distress by becoming detached. Redditor 32 wrote ""It's starting to get physically and emotionally draining, I'm starting to feel so detached from my body. I have no motivation what so ever. I just don't care anymore.""
Redditors at times expressed uncertainty about whether accessing help was worthwhile, given that doing so could worsen negative affect. Redditor 12 wrote: I've been trying to get past this crap for years, but things have consistently been getting in the way. Things like bad recovery environment, lack of support network, and moving around a lot and not being able to keep making progress with the same therapist. Each time I have to start over the flashbacks and nightmares come back, and I don't think I can take much more of starting over at the beginning again and again.
Avoidance-Based Coping. Avoidance-based coping reflected redditors' descriptions of avoiding thinking about the sexual assault, seeking help for it, or disclosing. Redditors within this theme faced barriers accessing supports, as well as benefitting from help when it was received. Avoidance is a common response to trauma, and refers to a person's unwillingness or inability to engage with internal experiences associated with the trauma, including memories, emotions, physiological sensations, and thoughts, as well as unwillingness to take action to reduce negative internal experiences (Burrows, 2013). Fifteen data extracts described avoidance-based coping.
Redditor 18 described avoidance during, and subsequent to, the sexual assault, which prevented her seeking medical care. She wrote: I didn't report it or go to the hospital at the time because honestly, the entire time I hoped one of the men would just kill me so it would all be over. I kind of just tried to suppress everything in the back of my mind and not let the flashbacks and anxiety and panicky moments take control and it worked for a while until recently.
In a similar vein, redditor 137 explained that although the negative effects of the assault were significant, she preferred to avoid directly addressing them. She wrote: Recently it's been affecting me a lot and my current relationship, I was supposed to go to rape counselling but can't go. I'm starting to think maybe I should just apologise to him and stop making a fuss about it. Also is it weird that a part of me doesn't wanna write on here in case someone helped? Pdf_Folio:130 Some redditors described having difficulty with, or being incapable of, disclosing the sexual assault in face-to-face settings. Redditor 144 described how her reluctance to disclose prevented her from seeking assistance:
I have not been able to tell anybody, I've been planning to post something like this for a long time even just type it out on a note on my phone but I feel sick just thinking about it, which is also why I have been scared of seeing someone professional about it.
Moreover, even once in therapy, redditors reported avoiding disclosure, thus limiting the benefit that could be obtained from the service. Redditor 16 wrote: I've told my therapist that a lot of my issues I'm currently struggling with are related to being hurt by a guy in my past. She says that when I'm ready I can begin to heal. The thing is . . . I am ready. I want to get better. I just don't want to talk about the rape. Can I just say that I was taken advantage of and leave it at that? I don't want to go into any details and I don't know if that's something therapists will ask if I tell her?
Echoing the lack of benefit experienced by redditor 16, redditor 35 wrote: I'm in therapy and I saw my therapist 2 weeks ago . . . I was about to open up about my rape (been in therapy for nearly 3 years and haven't told anyone or my therapist, was being helped for depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts . . . ) but as soon as I thought of the idea I froze and couldn't talk about it.
External Barriers
Availability of Services. This theme reflected pragmatic factors that prevented redditors from accessing help when it was wanted and included long wait times, being unable to afford counselling, or being located too far away from services. Eighteen data extracts described factors connected to the availability of services that undermined their helpseeking attempts.
Redditor 75 described being unable to advance in the healing process due to the wait time for accessing an appointment. She wrote, ""I've been to my local Sexual Assault Centre and have been making strides in my healing, but this is something we haven't covered, and it takes up to 2 months to book an appointment.""
Difficulty accessing services due to long wait times was at times compounded by issues related to the affordability of appropriate care. Redditor 46 wrote: I know I need help, but it seems like life keeps preventing me from doing so. I was advised to see a psychiatrist, but after calling about 10 psychiatrists in my area, 8 of them haven't called back, one was leaving the area, and I . . . no longer [had] insurance.
Another significant barrier faced by some redditors was that of their distance from the help that was available. As redditor 132 wrote:
It took 4 more months to get set up with another [therapist] but by then we had moved and the VA was already 45 minutes away, now it's over 1.5 hours. I have a son and go to school full time, it's just not feasible.
Suitability of Services.
Once a redditor found available help, that help was not always appropriate to her needs. Suitability of services referred to factors that either impeded access to appropriate help, or the redditor's ability to benefit from help when received. Twelve data extracts described barriers within this theme.
Four data extracts described concerns about the legal requirement for counsellors to report sexual assault against minors to authorities. For example, redditor 87 described her anxiety about her parents being told about the sexual assault should she disclose to a counsellor. She had held off seeking help for months and explained: I turn 18 in a week and for months I've been counting down the days until I can reach out to a professional without them alerting my parents. I feel like I'm going to explode because I've never explained in detail, to ANYONE, about what happened to me. It's not just something you can go around telling everyone in sight, y'know?
In some cases available services were, for a variety of reasons, perceived as not adequate to meet the redditor's needs. As redditor 2 explained:
They told me I should visit group therapy, as it would be quicker. I told them it won't help, because my views towards rape and what happened to me are 'insensitive ' to others. I'll be the first to admit that they are, and I think that's okay.
Redditor 125 also described an inadequate experience in therapy. She wrote: I've suffered from pretty severe PTSD and I recently decided to see a therapist. She listened to me, but gave me the number to a different therapist because she ""doesn't specialize in the kind of trauma that I've experienced."" I've yet to call to schedule an appointment. I kind of don't want to.
Expressing a similar sentiment, redditor 157 wrote ""I have tried counselling but the lady just tried to find music for us to listen to for half the session. It helped nothing."" Consonant with the experiences of other women in the sub-reddit, redditor 4 explained: Anyways, [my mother] . . . made me an appointment with a Christian therapist (she doesn't want me to go to anyone who isn't a Christian) but I'm worried that I won't be able to be honest with this therapist because I know that few Christians are okay with sex outside of marriage and that's where my problem is because of the flashbacks.
Therapist-Caused Harms. Nine data extracts described encounters with service providers (e.g., counsellors, psychologists, or psychiatrists) that were not only unsuitable to their needs, but detrimental to their well-being. At times, the harmful response from these providers caused the redditor to disengage from help-seeking. In some encounters, redditors reported that the provider was unsympathetic, blaming, or disbelieving. Redditor 39 wrote: I've been in counseling and didn't find it helpful. The last one I saw even made me feel worse -she said I was doing this to myself and that if I wanted to stop thinking about it I would just stop thinking about it. I got a lot worse while I was seeing her-panic attacks, feeling worthless-so I've stopped.
Redditor 20 also described a harmful encounter with a therapist. She wrote: I tried to tell her I had depression, and she was so rude (ex: ""I don't think that actually exists, you just want medication"") that I didn't even tell her about the incident. Apparently that's what most of the medical community is like here.
Reflecting on an encounter with her counsellor, redditor 58 wrote ""You replied that I was probably over reacting to arguments, and I should go back to apologize to him. This turned me away from much needed counseling for years."" Pdf_Folio:132
Stigma as Both an Internal and External Barrier
Stigma referred to the influence of negative and stereotypical beliefs about sexual assault on redditors' access to, and ability to derive benefit from, services. Redditors encountered this barrier both internally (intrapsychic stigma) and in their external environment (sociocultural stigma). Twenty data extracts reflected this theme. This theme revealed the influence of a hostile social climate on sexual assault survivors' ability to get appropriate help.
Intrapsychic Stigma. This subtheme referred to data extracts in which the redditor's own negative beliefs about sexual assault and survivors of sexual assault influenced their decision to refrain from help-seeking or created barriers to benefitting from help once received. Twelve data extracts reflected this theme.
Redditors within this subtheme reported negative self-evaluations. Redditor 6, for example, stated ""I really want help because I've been so depressed and disgusted with myself.""
Similarly, redditor 51 appeared to blame herself for what happened and reported feeling like an illegitimate, ""phony"" victim, because of her belief that she should have said ""no,"" and that a ""real"" rape should conform to a stereotypically traumatic experience. She explained:
I think I am ready to begin dealing with it but I am not sure that I qualify to go talk to someone at the local rape crisis center here. I feel like a phony because it is nowhere near as traumatic and horrible as other stories I read and I wonder if it is rape when I didn't ever say no.
Redditor 149 took this sentiment a step further, expressing both shame and self-blame: I've found myself wondering what this week has been like for him. Feeling like I'd like to apologize to him for contributing to the position he ended up in (with a girl who fully intended to have sex that night who ended up changing her mind). Putting that sentence into words is very hard to do and I'm ashamed and humiliated that I feel that way.
In circumstances where assistance had been gained, intrapsychic stigma at times prevented the redditor from fully beneffiting. Redditor 1, for example, described experiencing shame due to arousal at inappropriate times:
How normal or abnormal is physical sexual arousal (a woman getting ""wet "") in inappropriate or irrelevant situations? Especially for those with abuse and rape history that was handled by severe dissociation. Sometimes this happens if I have an intense emotional conversation about any topic with anyone I trust. Sometimes it happens during intense therapy appointments. Sometimes it happens when I visit my family of origin. I usually don't even notice ""in the moment"" because it's a purely physical response. But later I get up from where I was sitting or I walk out of the situation and I realize it and I struggle with the concept that I am gross and inappropriate. And the self hate just spirals from there. As one taught to the point of abusive to never speak of things. Even though I've been in counseling for years about my past I haven't been able to share this or ask about it because of the associated shame.
Sociocultural Stigma. Many of the redditors expressed awareness of prejudiced sociocultural views of women who experience sexual assault, and thus believed that help seeking would result in negative responses from service providers. This subtheme included nine data extracts.
Redditor 77 expressed the belief that seeking assistance would lead to a stigmatizing response and chose not to pursue help in order to protect her well-being. She wrote: Pdf_Folio:133 Everyone keeps saying to go and talk to a therapist about what happened but they don't understand. How am I supposed to talk to a complete stranger about what happened and what he did without them getting that look of disgust in their eyes or on their face. I've seen that look before and I'm not sure I can keep it together seeing it again. I don't want them to say that I'm so damaged and broken that I can't be fixed.
Moreover, some redditors referred to the influence of powerful figures in the social milieu who shape sociocultural attitudes and inhibit help-seeking. Redditor 30 wrote:
(There was a politician that a couple weeks ago came out and said something along the lines of ""It""s not rape if she's sleeping."") I just feel like the general mentality here is not very supportive of rape victims and then adding the lack of support from my friends makes me feel utterly alone in this.
Similarly, some data extracts referred more explicitly to rape myths as a deterrent to postassault assistance. Redditor 29 reflected on stereotypical beliefs about sex workers that minimize the occurrence and effects of sexual assault. She described the power dynamics inherent to sex work, in which customers can be perceived as reputable, but sex workers are highly stigmatized and considered disreputable. She wrote:
As a sex worker I am almost always thought of as being ""insatiable"" and someone who ""would never say no."" The man who raped me has a steady job and a college degree. The man who assaulted me is a business owner. How do you think those would go in court? So here I am without recourse & without anyone to talk to.
Discussion
Although past research has examined barriers to postassault services in face-to-face settings (e.g., Ahrens, Stansell, & Jennings, 2010;Patterson et al., 2009), to our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to examine narratives posted by sexual assault survivors on an online forum. Compared to data generated in face-to-face settings, narratives posted to reddit are unique because they are often disinhibited and are not elicited in response to specific questions.
Analysis of the narratives highlights the complex, often intersecting factors that acted as barriers to survivors accessing help and benefitting from help once received. What is clear from these narratives is that despite progress in our collective understanding of sexual assault, and several reports in the US and Canadian news media highlighting allegations against well-known men, the stigma experienced by sexual assault survivors is still prevalent, painful and prejudicial and influences their help-seeking and well-being. Stigma is embedded within erroneous social beliefs made visible through the perpetuation of ""rape myths""that shape care providers' attitudes (sociocultural stigma), as well as the attitudes of survivors themselves (intrapsychic stigma).
As in other studies (Logan, Evans, Stevenson, & Jordan, 2005;Patterson et al., 2009), survivors who had not sought help were concerned that they would be poorly treated by help providers. Quinn and Earnshaw (2013) referred to anticipated stigma to describe awareness of negative stereotypes toward one's identity and expectation of bad treatment. The insidious influence of sexual assault stereotypes on survivors' beliefs about how they would be treated by care providers when accessing services constituted a substantial barrier to obtaining support. This suggests that greater effort needs to be spent on challenging the stereotypes that hold sway in the court of public opinion. Additional education for the public and particularly for providers is necessary to counter the potential harm caused by a lack Pdf_Folio:134 of understanding of sexual assault itself and the ways in which harmful values and beliefs continue to denigrate survivors.
Intrapsychic stigma, or as others have called it, internalized stigma, occurs when the individual applies stereotypical beliefs to the self, leading to a belief in having a devalued or degraded identity (Quinn & Earnshaw, 2013). Survivors in the study sample reported shame, self-blame, disgust and embarrassment, a reflection of the devaluation of sexual assault survivors in wider society (Edwards, Turchik, Dardis, Reynolds, & Gidycz, 2011). In addition to preventing these survivors from obtaining needed services and supports, the stigma itself may have had additional health consequences. Individuals with concealed stigma frequently experience multiple stressors, which may include decisional conflict linked to disclosing one's identity, anxiety about being ""found out,"" feelings of selfalienation, and isolation from others (Moors & Webber, 2012;Pachankis, 2007). These factors may lead to higher levels of psychological distress (Quinn & Earnshaw, 2013).
The current findings suggest that, although survivors may have substantial postassault mental health needs, seeking services from mental health providers may not always be beneficial but instead serve to compound the trauma associated with the sexual assault. The treatment described by survivors in this study who were hurt or otherwise harmed by their encounters with therapists provides additional evidence of the damage caused by victimblaming and stigmatizing attitudes and was particularly disheartening to find within mental health services. This is consistent with some earlier research that has reported one in four women receiving mental health services postassault considered their experience harmful (Campbell, Wasco, Ahrens, Self, & Barnes, 2001).
Even for survivors who were in established counselling relationships, disclosing the sexual assault was difficult, with some choosing to avoid the topic altogether. Avoidance is a recognized coping strategy in response to PTSD (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014). Although responses to trauma can vary widely, traumatic stress often results in extremes, with survivors feeling excessive and overwhelming emotion, or numbed affect (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014). It is unclear whether continued avoidance, even within environments that appear relatively safe, reflects survivors' anticipation or internalization of stigma, or other factors such as PTSD (Quinn & Earnshaw, 2013).
Some survivors reported that they were unable to access needed services despite having overwhelming emotional affect and physiological problems due to external factors such as work commitments, parenting responsibilities, inadequate access to supportive social networks, lack of nearby services, and low socioeconomic status (Kennedy et al., 2012). Indeed, key concerns within the ""availability of services"" theme were the financial burden and long wait lists associated with mental health services, with many survivors reporting repeated attempts to access the care needed. This theme highlights inequities in access to care and the need for investments in a range of services that address the complex needs of sexual assault survivors.
The suitability of services was also a significant issue for the survivors. Even when multiple logistical barriers were overcome, services often did not benefit them. The failure of available services to benefit survivors may have reflected poor ecological fit with their needs, including issues related to therapeutic modality and training, as well as age of independence and religion. Additionally, services that do not take into account other essential factors, such as their social location, co-occurring stressors and life events, and cumulative victimization, may shape their needs at a given time (Kennedy et al., 2012).

Limitations and Strengths
This study has several limitations. Data on demographic variables such as socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity and age, that influence social location, could not be consistently gathered from reddit. In addition, only those individuals with knowledge of, and skill with, online modalities have access to reddit. Older age and low socioeconomic status are associated with decreased access to the internet and online communities (Aerschot & Rodousakis, 2008). As a result, the current study's findings may not be generalizable to those who are unable to express themselves using online formats (Fawcett & Shrestha, 2016). Further, social location exerts a powerful influence on vulnerability to se",6698,7687

Support seeking in stigmatized contexts is useful when the discloser receives the desired response, but it also entails social risks. Thus, people do not always disclose or seek support when they need it. One such stigmatized context for support seeking is sexual abuse. In this paper, we use mixed methods to understand abuse-related posts on reddit. First, we take a qualitative approach to understand post content. Then we use quantitative methods to investigate the use of ""throwaway"" accounts, which provide greater anonymity, and report on factors associated with support seeking and first-time disclosures. In addition to significant linguistic differences between throwaway and identified accounts, we find that those using throwaway accounts are significantly more likely to engage in seeking support. We also find that men are significantly more likely to use throwaway accounts when posting about sexual abuse. Results suggest that subreddit moderators and members who wish to provide support pay attention to throwaway accounts, and we discuss the importance of context-specific anonymity in support seeking.
",2003,American Psychologist,,"INTRODUCTION
Opportunities for anonymity are central to decisions about self-disclosure [14,47]. According to sociologist Gary Marx, anonymity ""means that a person cannot be identified according to any of seven dimensions of identity knowledge,"" including legal name, location, behavior patterns, social group membership, identifying personal characteristics, or pseudonyms that can be linked with these [44]. In computer-mediated communication, anonymity has been linked to less accountability [35] and more disinhibition [37,64]. Increased disinhibition might lead to negative behaviors such as bullying and flaming [35], but may also be therapeutic by allowing disclosures of taboo or stigmatized topics [6,8].
Abuse in general, and sexual abuse and rape in particular, is one context that is socially stigmatized and difficult for people to talk about in both non-computer-mediated and computer-mediated contexts. Different countries have different definitions of rape and sexual assault, so statistics are difficult to compare globally. In the United States, there are on average 293,066 victims (age 12 or older) of rape and sexual assault each year [53,63] and it is estimated that 68% of sexual assaults go unreported to authorities [53]. The negative long-term impacts of sexual assault are well documented and include immediate and enduring emotions such as anger, anxiety, depression, self-blame, guilt, shame, humiliation, fear, a sense of loss, helplessness, isolation, low self-esteem, and interpersonal difficulties [27,33].
Sexual abuse disclosures are often difficult and delayed, causing additional emotional distress [52]. Sometimes survivors never disclose their sexual abuse, or disclose it years later [52] and when they do disclose, the response that some survivors endure often make them more reluctant to further disclose [68]. Non-disclosure of abuse has negative health outcomes [61], while disclosure and support seeking has good psychological effects [55].
Although seeking support can be helpful for sexual abuse survivors, people have difficulty doing so for many reasons. One risk of seeking support is losing ""face,"" in Goffman's terms; ""face"" being the positive self-image that people present in their social interactions, wish to maintain, and feel discontent without [31]. People seek support directly or indirectly [5]. Direct disclosures are more likely to lead to support while indirect methods could be misunderstood or ignored [5]. Those dealing with stigmatized problems are more likely to seek support indirectly [7].
Despite the importance of sexual abuse-related disclosure and support, there is little HCI work that investigates the experiences of sexual abuse victims who seek support online, or the kinds of online cultures and technical affordances that support or inhibit such disclosures. This paper fills an important gap by building on previous work about online support seeking and self-disclosure in the context of psychologically vulnerable disclosures [4]. Similar to this previous work, our study examines support seeking through the lens of self-disclosure; additionally, we examine the role that anonymity plays in sexual abuserelated disclosures.
While there is increasing debate around whether people have a ""right"" to anonymity (e.g., [22]), some major social media sites require people to use ""real"" or legal names. reddit is a social media site that not only does not have a ""real name"" policy and allows pseudonyms, but also allows ""throwaway accounts:"" temporary accounts that a user can create without any link to their primary reddit identity [42]. Because many of these accounts are used exactly once [29], user behavior can be untraceable over time, and different throwaway posts by one person are not linkable to each other or to content that that user might share using their primary reddit identity. Although throwaway accounts do not match rigorous definitions of anonymity such as that of Marx [44], research suggests they are perceived to provide an acceptable level of anonymity [29,42,70]. Following [50], we use the terms ""identified"" and ""throwaway"" to distinguish pseudonymous from anonymous identities.
Since people make both anonymous and identified (though often pseudonymous) posts on forums like reddit, we set out to understand support seeking on the site in the context of sexual abuse. There exist several subreddits (reddit forums focused on specific topics) dedicated to the topics of abuse and rape. We investigate whether and how these subreddits provide an opportunity for self-disclosures by sexual abuse survivors and explore relationships among anonymity, disclosure, and support seeking by analyzing content from both anonymous (throwaway) and identified (non-throwaway) accounts. Specifically, we ask: RQ1. What do people disclose in abuse-related subreddits?
RQ2. What factors are significantly associated with a post being from a throwaway rather than an identified account?
RQ3. What factors are significantly associated with support seeking? How do these factors differ between direct and indirect support seeking? RQ4. What post-related factors are significantly associated with first-time disclosures (i.e., disclosures happening for the very first time offline and online)?
PRIOR WORK

Seeking Support
Goffman posits that people need ""sympathetic others:"" those who share the same social stigma, have had similar experiences, and those who ""share with him the feeling that he is human and 'essentially' normal in spite of appearances and in spite of his own self doubt"" [13:31].
Even though people who are struggling or are in distress could benefit from seeking and receiving support and interactions with ""sympathetic others"" might be of help, many factors make it hard for individuals to reach out. Support seeking difficulties include the fact that people may look weak or less competent by admitting that they have a problem and need help, and in so doing they present an undesired image of self [31]. Additionally, information may be disclosed that makes the discloser feel vulnerable, and sometimes the problem for which help is required is already stigmatized or leads to stigmatization [10]. Another reason one might be inhibited from seeking support or selfdisclosure is being concerned about the potential effects on the relationship between the confidant and the abuser [40]. Finally, people might feel pressured to reciprocate or be called on to do so if they seek support and receive it [2].
On the other hand, in offline contexts, factors that contribute to seeking social support include perceptions of trustworthiness, stigma attached to the issue, proximity to sources of support, availability of support, gender norms, and cultural norms [7]. With respect to gender norms, in many cultures men are socialized to believe that they should be able to handle problems on their own, while women are socialized to believe that it is okay to be emotional, talk about their problems, and seek help [45]. Barbee's [5] typology of support seeking behavior posits that there are both verbal and non-verbal ways, as well as direct and indirect ways, of seeking support. Direct support seeking is requesting help and indirect support seeking is hinting a problem exists. In this paper, we categorize support seeking in terms of direct versus indirect seeking.
The Social Support Behavioral Code [16] is also a categorization schema that we employ in this paper to characterize the nature of support being sought. This schema includes informational support (providing information or advice), instrumental (tangible) support (express willingness to help in a tangible way or actually do so such as offer to talk to someone or do something for them), esteem support (communicating respect and confidence in abilities by acts such as complimenting one), network support (communicating belonging to a group of people with similar concerns or experiences), and emotional support (communicating love, concern, or empathy).
Different people might prefer different types of support [65]. Understanding people's preferences for support is important because received social support that matches one's needs and preferences improves psychological adjustment, efficacy, ability to cope with distressing events, resistance to illness, recovery from illness, and life expectancy [11,45].
Anonymity and Seeking Support Online
When they feel anonymous, people are more likely to disclose personal information [38]. Anonymity, along with the absence of nonverbal cues in online environments,
Affording Collective Action in Social Media
#chi4good, CHI 2016, San Jose, CA, USA facilitates more intimate disclosures [66]. With the increasing presence of Internet in people's lives, many have started to utilize online support groups. Online support groups need not worry about gestures, facial expressions, voice or physical appearance; as such they can better control and articulate their message [71]. Social distance, anonymity, interaction management, and access are some of the major attractions of these groups [25,71]. In fact, the most frequently mentioned advantage of online support groups is the perception that less stigma is attached to one's condition by other group members due to heightened feelings of anonymity compared to offline settings [73].
Online social platforms are widely used for health-related discourse [28], and prior work has shown that online spaces can be useful resources for those seeking help and support with mental health issues (e.g., [48]). Research suggests that online health support group users benefit from information and support exchange [26,30,59]. Some researchers have used content analysis to understand the type of content shared in online support groups [17,25,51].
Posts on an online anonymous forum for moms discuss situations and issues about being a mom that are not in line with societal and cultural norms [58]. A recent study investigated depression-tagged posts on Instagram and found that people often disclose personal narratives and stories, negative emotions, and self-appearance concerns, and seek social contact [4]. Others have used computational techniques to infer mental health conditions from social media data [18,19], such as using classifiers to detect posts discussing domestic abuse on reddit [54].
On reddit, throwaway accounts are used as a proxy for anonymity [42]. Prior work on mental-health related reddit posts suggests that throwaway posts are more disinhibited and are associated with increased negativity, lowered selfesteem, cognitive bias, and self-attentional focus [50]. We follow up by investigating how abuse-related posts and help seeking differs between throwaway and identified accounts.
Disclosure and Sexual Abuse
Self-disclosure is defined as a ""willful disclosure"" where the ""aim is to let another person know with no shadow of a doubt what you have done, what you feel, etc."" [34]. Selfdisclosure involves navigating the boundary between safely hiding and making one's self vulnerable. It is a tactic that people use, especially online, to find similarly stigmatized others with the hope of benefiting and receiving support [12]. The Disclosure Processes Model (DPM) [12] examines when and why interpersonal disclosure may be beneficial and focuses on people with concealable stigmatized identities (e.g., abuse, rape) in non-computermediated contexts. This model identifies depth, breadth, duration, and emotional content as critical aspects of disclosure. Self-disclosure is the central concept underlying our framing of social support and we employ the dimensions of DPM in our qualitative analysis of posts in the subreddits we study.
A majority of rapes and sexual assaults occur prior to adulthood, yet individuals are more likely to not disclose their experiences until they are adults [41]. There are substantial gender differences in disclosures. Although sexual abuse is under-disclosed and under-reported in general, women are more likely to disclose than men [69].
One reason why male sexual abuse is under-reported and under-disclosed is due to stigma and the ""male ethic of selfreliance"" [57]. Reasons for men's lack of disclosure or struggle with disclosure may be personal (e.g., unawareness, avoidance, difficulty articulating, shame, lack of emotional safety), relational (e.g., fear of negative response and repercussions, potential for disruption, possible isolation), and sociocultural (e.g., social unacceptability) [62]. Among survivors of childhood sexual abuse, women are more likely to receive positive reactions, but report more distress, more self-blame, more withdrawal, and more attempts to forget than men [69].
Limited research exists focused on online sexual abuse disclosures. One study of sexual assault-related questions and answers on Yahoo! Answers (a non-anonymous site on which users must be registered) found that help-seeking occurred, but only rarely, and mostly involved seeking emotional support [47]. The study suggested that such posts are about naming the incident as sexual assault, recounting one's story, expressing emotions, and seeking help.
Characteristics and patterns of abuse-related self-disclosure and support seeking in online social media is an understudied area in HCI research. By employing mixed methods and studying self-disclosure, nuances of support seeking, and anonymity in this population, we can better understand the ways that online platforms can enable positive and therapeutic disclosures, potentially leading to healing in a wide array of contexts.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN
To address our research questions, we report on two study phases. In the first phase, we characterize the content of abuse-related posts in three subreddits through a selfdisclosure lens by applying qualitative content analysis methods. In the second phase, we use statistical methods to investigate the differences between throwaway and identified posts in terms of the themes we find in the first phase. We also employ a text mining approach to investigate differences between throwaway and identified accounts. Finally, we report on factors linked to direct and indirect support seeking and first-time disclosures of abuse.
Data Collection
Obtaining Sexual Abuse Data. We used reddit's official API [74] to collect posts, comments, and associated metadata from several communities (subreddits) focused on sexual abuse. The subreddits were identified using prior work on mental health, well-being and psychological distress-related concerns on reddit [20,50]. We manually examined the subreddit descriptions and goals as well as posts shared in all of the 22 subreddits studied in previous Affording Collective Action in Social Media #chi4good, CHI 2016, San Jose, CA, USA work [20,50] to identify those dedicated to discourse and support around sexual abuse. Additionally, we used reddit's native search functionality to search for subreddits relating to the keyword ""sexual abuse."" Using these methods, we identified three subreddits that were exclusively focused on sexual abuse: r/traumatoolbox, r/rapecounseling, and r/survivorsofabuse. At the time of writing this paper, these subreddits each had 600-4,000 subscribers. Note that redditors can post on a subreddit without also subscribing to it. All of these subreddits host public content. For each of these subreddits, we obtained daily crawls of posts in the New category, to collect posts shared in the three subreddits between February and November 2014.
Identifying Throwaways. Now we discuss our method of identifying throwaway user accounts in our data. We used a two-step approach based on prior work [29,42,50]. The first step (programmatically) examined the naming conventions used in the user ids, and whether they include mentioning the word ""throwaway"" or a lexical variation of the word (e.g., *thrw*, *throwaway*, *throw*, *thrw*, *thraway*) [29]. In the second step, we (programmatically) looked for mentions of the word ""throwaway"" in either post titles or post text. One author followed up with manual inspection of a random sample of these posts to verify that the word ""throwaway"" was used to mean an anonymous disclosure.
The manual second step is motivated by prior work done on reddit ""throwaway"" accounts [42]. While it is possible that this technique yielded some false negatives, it ensures that our dataset represents throwaway accounts accurately.
Our complete dataset included a total of 234 posts from throwaway accounts and 2,139 posts from identified accounts. Because we wanted to compare content across throwaway and non-throwaway accounts, we randomly selected 100 posts from throwaway accounts and the same number from identified accounts: thus a combined sample of 200 posts. During data coding, we removed posts that included only an external link without explanation, spam, and posts that were not possible to put into context and understand. The final analyzed dataset consisted of 189 posts: 96 from throwaway and 93 from identified accounts.
Methods and Analysis
To develop a codebook for the posts, we followed an iterative semi-open coding procedure. In doing so, we looked for some concepts from the literature and prior work. For example, different forms of seeking support (i.e., direct versus indirect, and informational, emotional, etc.).
We also employed open coding, remaining sensitive to other topics that might emerge. Two of the authors independently coded a test sample of 20 randomly selected posts drawn from the larger dataset, then discussed each post together with assigned codes to establish a shared vocabulary. Next, they coded another 20 randomly selected test posts and similarly discussed them one by one in detail.
Applying the resulting codebook, they coded a final set of randomly selected 20 posts to establish inter-rater reliability, which yielded an overall Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.86. Next, the two coders independently coded portions of the 189 posts. We assigned multiple codes to each post, and our unit of analysis was posts.
We coded for disclosure content based on the DPM model [12] discussed above. Duration did not apply to our data, but we coded for the other three dimensions (depth, breadth, and emotional content). Our story-telling theme, as we will describe in findings, is a proxy for a disclosure's breadth and depth. To capture emotional content, we opencoded emotional expressions in the data, then one author categorized the emotions into standard emotional categories based on Shaver et al.'s emotion categorization [60].
We coded for support seeking at two levels. First, we coded for direct versus indirect support seeking. Second, when support was sought directly, we coded for specific types of support seeking as categorized in the Social Support Behavioral Code [16] described above.
Limitations
We analyzed posts on three subreddits (r/traumatoolbox, r/rapecounseling, and r/survivorsofabuse) to characterize self-disclosures about abuse, with a focus on sexual abuse and rape experiences. While we recognize that our data might not be representative of the wide population who experience abuse and rape (e.g., not everyone has access to the Internet, or uses reddit) or even the narrower population who post on these subreddits, we believe our approach is sufficiently robust to provide a foundation for understanding abuse-related self-disclosures and support seeking and the role of anonymity in these behaviors. We believe that we could also gain important insights by talking to redditors who post on these subreddits and the moderators and volunteers who provide support -an important direction for future research.
FINDINGS
In this section, we first share a summary of our findings from phase I and phase II respectively. We then report them in more detail. Our qualitative analysis contributes a characterization of abuse-related posts in online forums through a self-disclosure lens. Our quantitative analysis suggests that there are significant differences between posts from throwaway accounts and identified accounts in the context of disclosures relating to sexual abuse. Posts including indirect and direct support seeking, references to attitudes toward disclosure, and posts by men were more likely to be posted using throwaway accounts. Throwaway posts were also significantly linguistically different than identified posts. We also found that while emotional disclosure (i. Table 1 details the themes that emerged in the data and each theme's percentage of occurrences in posts.
Disclosure dimensions
While most of the disclosures described a poster's personal experience with abuse, sometimes others' experiences with abuse were discussed, and sometimes posts were mixed. Most abuse disclosures referred to rape and sexual assault, appearing in a total of 66.1% of posts. Other types of abuse were also disclosed, with a combined total of 77.8% posts including some form of disclosure about abuse.
Emotional disclosure was also common in our data. We observed five emotion categories: Sadness (e.g., depressed, despair, broken, hopeless, sad, suicidal, confused, lost, traumatized, empty), fear (e.g., nervousness, anxiety, social anxiety, scared), anger (e.g., angry, disgusted, disturbed, frustrated, dirty, self-hatred), shame (e.g., guilty, ashamed, regretful, self-blame), and neglect (e.g., embarrassed, lonely, worthless). Although negative emotions are generally difficult to express, some, such as shame, are still harder [56], as reflected by the 27% prevalence in Table 1.
We also observed considerable breadth and depth of disclosure through storytelling. Writing down problems in online support groups might enable more distance from others, reflection, and less concern about immediate responses [72]. It can also create distance between people and their dilemmas, help externalize these problems, take them out of isolation, and connect them to the larger culture [21]. Due to space limitations and to satisfy ethical standards for reporting sensitive disclosures, we generally include partial reworded sentences in posts that exemplify the themes we discuss. However, because it is difficult to convey the storytelling theme without providing a complete example, we include this paraphrased post as an instance of detailed disclosure about an abuse event through storytelling coupled with feelings of fear and sadness: In this storytelling example, the poster refers to his attitudes towards disclosure (hoping it helps others) while also seeking indirect support and providing network support.
Attitudes toward disclosure
Attitudes toward disclosure was a prevalent theme in our analysis. Posts often included reasons for disclosure or nondisclosure, fears regarding disclosure, and desire to engage in self-disclosure. Out of the 27% of posts that included references to desire to disclose, 20% referred to the reasons for disclosing on reddit:
I was in my bed thinking that I have never talked to anyone with a similar experience, and thought I might find comfort in that, or maybe some people I can relate to about this.
Past disclosure outcomes 26.5% of posts mentioned that they had disclosed the abuse at some point before posting on reddit. Confidants included families, friends, significant others, therapists, and authorities. Redditors who had disclosed before posting often described confidants' reactions and most of these posts described unsupportive responses: In this example, disclosure led to temporarily diminished intimacy between the poster and the confidant. Negative responses to disclosures in offline contexts may precipitate support seeking in online forums like reddit.
Seeking support
Seeking support was a major theme, with direct support seeking three times more prevalent than indirect support seeking. Informational (i.e., seeking advice, opinions, and information) was the most prevalent type of direct support seeking, followed by network, esteem, emotional, and instrumental. We give examples below:
Seeking direct informational support involves asking for others' input: ""Any advice would be appreciated."" We also coded for how posts were framed. Some posts included explicit questions, while others were framed to make sense of the abuse, emotions, and thoughts. For example, a poster might share a story and then say: ""I want to make sense of this,"" while others ask direct questions such as ""how do I get back to being functional?""
Platform-specific themes
We also observed two platform-specific themes in our analysis. The first refers to first-time-ever disclosures that happened on reddit and the second refers to considerable references to a specific or more general imagined audience.
First-time disclosure: ""Hi. Throwaway because I haven't mentioned this to anyone, and I find it hard to talk about.""
Audience awareness: ""I've posted here before with this throwaway and you were all so kind. I'm having a new problem, so I thought to come back here.""
Gender
Finally, in 57.5% of posts we identified the poster's gender based on explicit identification or reference. Among those whose gender could be identified, there were 2.5 times more women than men. This finding pertains to posts in which posters explicitly identified with a gender.
In summary, we found considerable support seeking and detailed, emotional disclosures. We observed awareness of audience and references to attitudes towards disclosure and abuse. Importantly, we observed first-time disclosures and references to responses received to previous disclosures. We identified 4 posts by abusers, yielding no themes.
Phase II. Statistical Analyses
In this section, we use statistical analysis to address research questions 2-4.
RQ2. What factors are significantly associated with a post being from a throwaway rather than an identified account?
To answer this question we: 1) used qualitative findings from Phase I to investigate what post features were more likely to appear from throwaway accounts, and 2)
Affording Collective Action in Social Media #chi4good, CHI 2016, San Jose, CA, USA quantitatively analyzed posts' text to identify differences between throwaway and identified accounts.
1) Differences in post types between throwaway and identified posts
We developed logistic regression models using backwards variable selection (an appropriate method when not beginning with an a priori set of variables) to identify the optimal models explaining our data, which we report in Table 2. We report two models with a binary indicator of an account being a throwaway as the dependent variable in each (see Table 2). The difference between Model 1 and 2 is that in the first, we included the five different types of direct support seeking whereas in the second, we entered direct support seeking as a general category (i.e., the presence of any type of direct support seeking). We did this to delve deeper into the relationship between support seeking behavior and anonymity. We found no multicollinearity effects.
We found that posts including indirect as well as direct (specifically informational and esteem support) support seeking, references to attitudes toward disclosure, and posts by men were more likely to be from throwaway accounts. Methods such as interviews could illuminate posters' motivations for using throwaway accounts to indirectly seek support; however, one explanation for the observed relationship between indirectly seeking support and using a throwaway account could be that these posters sense that a more direct disclosure would lead to negative reactions (as is found in the literature [41]), and so are hesitant to engage in direct support seeking. Another possible explanation is that sometimes people may not know what it is that they need, or may just want to vent. In these cases, they would not directly ask for help.
Additionally, we found that certain forms of directly seeking support -specifically informational and esteemare also associated with using a throwaway account. It may be that stressful events that threaten people's self-concept, such as sexual abuse and rape, would best benefit from esteem support [15,36]. Feelings of uncertainty about the experience and not knowing what to do is common for people who have experienced abuse or rape [47]. These both may lead to a poster admitting she does not know something and is confused, and that she needs validation; all of which threaten self-image. Therefore, these posters may choose to directly seek support anonymously to reduce risks of losing face. Another explanation is that in the context of sexual abuse and rape, direct offline disclosures receive more negative responses [41]. To save face in the event that they receive unsupportive responses, posters might make direct bids for support anonymously.
Posts that described a desire and need to engage in selfdisclosure about abuse, as well as those that included reasons for engaging or not engaging in self-disclosure were more likely to be from throwaway accounts. In 9.0% of posts, the poster specifically mentioned that they desired to disclose on reddit while 14.5% mentioned that they need a ""safe"" disclosure space. Some people using throwaway accounts pointed to reasons for doing so. For example, one poster said, ""and for the throwaway, i don't want to get into trouble,"" while another stated, ""i made a throwaway as i think some family members know about my main account and none of them know about my story.""
Posters may use such explanations or references to disclosure attitudes because they want their audience to know that they have a reason for choosing to be more anonymous. This may make them seem more credible and trustworthy as a member, despite their anonymity. Another explanation could be that those who use throwaway accounts are in dire need of disclosure, and explicitly referring to this need as additional context to their posts may increase the likelihood of receiving a desired response.
In our data, men were significantly more likely to use throwaway accounts although prior research [42] suggests that women are more likely to use throwaway accounts on reddit overall. Our results highlight the importance of the context in which we talk about the use of temporary sociotechnical identities. It is likely that because disclosing abuse is more stigmatized for men than women, men seek anonymity by using throwaway accounts when disclosing.
2) Quantitative text mining to identify content in throwaway posts
As part of our characterization of anonymity in sexual abuse subreddits, we quantitatively analyzed posts' text to identify differences between throwaway and identified accounts. Using the full dataset of 2,373 posts (9.9% from throwaway accounts), we built two logistic regression classification models, both with a binary indicator of a throwaway account as the dependent variable (see Table 3). The first model used unigrams and bi-grams in posts' text as independent variables, calculating their frequency by count. The second model also used unigrams and bi-grams in posts' text as independent variables, but instead calculated the frequency of each using term frequencyinverse document frequency (tf-idf) [43]. For each, we applied 10 fold cross-validation to prevent overfitting, and we report the results from the most accurate model. The models performed well: on average over the 10 folds, the model using counts had accuracy 0.91 and AUC (area under the curve) 0.63, and the model using tf-idf had accuracy 0.91 and AUC 0.63. The numbers in Table 3 are coefficients for the logistic regression classification model; as the prevalence of terms increase by one unit, the log odds ratio that the account is a throwaway increases by the amount of that coefficient.
We present the results of this classification model to highlight two important findings: (1) sexual abuse related posts made using throwaway accounts and identified accounts are linguistically different enough that we can quantitatively distinguish between the two types, and (2) the words and sets of words here contribute to the characterization of anonymity in sexual abuse forums. We hesitate to speculate regarding the nature and meaning of the unigrams and bi-grams that are significantly different between throwaways and identified accounts. However, we note several terms more common in throwaways that may connote childhood sexual abuse (e.g., ""child,"" ""mom even,"" ""her younger""), potentially signaling adulthood disclosure of abuse from one's childhood. We also identify several temporally related terms (e.g., ""than month,"" ""for years""), as well as terms that may be related to alcohol consumption (e.g., ""so drunk,"" ""and d",6392,7231

Seeking and providing support is challenging. When people disclose sensitive information, audience responses can substantially impact the discloser's wellbeing. We use mixed methods to understand responses to online sexual abuse-related disclosures on Reddit. We characterize disclosure responses, then investigate relationships between post content, comment content, and anonymity. We illustrate what types of support sought and provided in posts and comments co-occur. We find that posts seeking support receive more comments, and comments from ""throwaway"" (i.e., anonymous) accounts are more likely on posts also from throwaway accounts. Anonymous commenting enables commenters to share intimate content such as reciprocal disclosures and supportive messages, and commenter anonymity is not associated with aggressive or unsupportive comments. We argue that anonymity is an essential factor in designing social technologies that facilitate support seeking and provision in socially stigmatized contexts, and provide implications for social media site design.

Social media platforms are often celebrated for their capacity to connect. However, when people experience severe distress, trauma, or stigmatized experiences (e.g., pregnancy loss, HIV, terminal illness diagnosis), they may find it difficult to use these platforms to talk about such experiences and feelings associated with them, or seek support; yet the need to disclose these experiences often remains [91]. The potential to receive social support often motivates people to make sensitive self-disclosures [45]. Support can take multiple forms [27], and receiving helpful social support after sensitive disclosures are made is linked to improved wellbeing [74]. Sexual abuse is one important example of a highly stigmatized human experience that is difficult to disclose and seek support around, but for which receiving support is vital for many [105].
Abuse survivors often fear receiving unsupportive reactions and rejection from confidants [53,59]. However, disclosing these experiences, if met with supportive reactions, may be healing for the discloser and lead to improved mental health [24,106]. Survivors of sexual abuse often do not disclose relevant experiences and feelings, and those who do, do not always receive supportive and validating responses from family, friends, and others [24,36,53]. Unsupportive responses may further inhibit future disclosures or support seeking [101], and are likely to negatively influence psychological wellbeing [28]. Therefore, responses to disclosures of sexual abuse are an important outcome of disclosures when they do occur. Social computing systems can be designed to allow people to disclose stigmatized experiences, seek and provide support, or find the kind of support they need the most. Yet to understand how to design systems to best facilitate social support exchange, or the utility of existing systems for support seeking and provision, we must first understand how people currently seek support, and how others respond to them. This article is a contribution to this end. We examine sexual abuse disclosures on Reddit as a case study to contribute an understanding of support provision via responses to social media posts.
In 2017, #metoo went viral as the marker of a social media campaign in which survivors shared their experiences with sexual abuse and harassment, largely on social media platforms, such as Facebook [75,76], where they are connected to known others such as family, friends, and colleagues [51]. Those who considered speaking about their experiences to their networks of known ties likely had to make complicated decisions, weighing factors related to themselves, their audience, network, temporality, society, and the respective platform (as found in the context of other stigmatized disclosure decisions on Facebook) [5]. While some shared detailed accounts of their experiences, others posted #metoo without providing details, which may further illustrate the difficulties of speaking about these experiences together with a need to express what one has been through and an urge to join a larger movement. However, many others may not have felt comfortable or desired to share sensitive information about sexual abuse and harassment to their ""real life"" networks, even within the context of a social movement like #metoo and others' disclosures, both of which are factors that facilitate stigmatized disclosures to networks of known ties [5]. The impact of #metoo went beyond social media; crisis hotlines (which are often anonymous and confidential) reported received increased calls in the wake of #metoo both from those who had recently experienced abuse and those who had experienced it in the past and sought help to process buried trauma [75]. While our study and data are not in the context of #metoo specifically, our work allows important insight into this current movement by examining some of the less visible, but still important, ways people disclose sensitive sexual abuse experiences online.
Social media platforms that allow anonymity, and enable communities of similar others to gather around a shared experience, are important online spaces for people to share sensitive disclosures, and open them up to receive support from others without the risks that may accompany identified disclosures. People have been using online support forums for many years, and scholars have studied the content on these forums as well as the functions they serve (e.g., [29,38,81,96]). Some online support groups and forums are specifically dedicated to supporting sexual abuse survivors. Overall, these forums are perceived to be safe spaces to talk about difficult experiences and connect with similar others who have been through similar experiences, both locally and globally [74].
Social Support, Reciprocity, and Anonymity in Responses to Sexual Abuse Disclosures 28:3
Reduced stigma and the ability to disclose information to others with less interpersonal risk are also important functions of support groups and forums [74]. Advantages of these groups include some degree of anonymity (often loosely defined as not using ""real names"") and not being constrained by time and space due to the possibility of asynchronous communication [38]. When people share their abuse-related experiences (or other stigmatized experiences), thoughts, and feelings on these forums, readers may react in several ways. A reader may not leave a response at all, or they may leave a response that communicates support, share their own experiences, or leave an unsupportive or aggressive response [7]. Given the importance of responses in the disclosure and coping process, and because people have adopted online platforms to engage in such disclosures, it is critical to understand how others engage with sensitive disclosures on online platforms and what kinds of responses these disclosures receive. In this article, we investigate one context in which such anonymous disclosures and responses to them take place. We examine sexual abuse disclosures on Reddit, and responses to them, as a case study of behaviors around sensitive disclosures and responses on social media more broadly.
We chose the social media platform Reddit as the site for our research study for several reasons. First, several ""subreddits,"" or communities on Reddit, are specifically dedicated to sexual abuse topics. Reddit also provides a rich context to uncover the influence of different levels of anonymity: people regularly use pseudonyms, but Reddit also affords an additional layer of anonymity through throwaway accounts [66]. Throwaway accounts are temporary accounts without any link to a person's primary Reddit identity [66]. Many throwaway accounts are used only once [42]. User behavior associated with throwaway accounts is generally not traceable over time, and several throwaway posts by one person are not linkable to each other or to posts that one might share using their primary Reddit identity. Marxfoot_1 [72] observed that anonymity is not a binary construct, but that partial anonymity can satisfy needs in different social and legal contexts; on Reddit, throwaway accounts are perceived to provide a level of anonymity that goes beyond that of primary-even pseudonymous-Reddit accounts [42,66,109]. Following prior work [6], we use the terms ""identified"" and ""throwaway"" to distinguish primary pseudonymous from more anonymous Reddit identities throughout this article.
In our prior work [6], we characterized sexual abuse disclosures on abuse-related subreddits, and the role that the additional anonymity afforded by throwaway accounts played in these disclosures. Among other things, this prior work showed how these subreddits were used for disclosures and seeking support, and even sometimes for first-time disclosures. This work also established that there are significant differences between posts from throwaway accounts and identified accounts in the context of sexual abuse disclosures. If people use these spaces to engage in difficult disclosures and seek support from others, it is important to understand what happens next. Thus, in the current article, we examine responses that people receive to sensitive disclosures, whether these online spaces do provide them with the type(s) of support they are looking for, and the potential role of higher degrees of anonymity in observed response behaviors.
Although previous research has examined general uses and functions of online support forums in other contexts (e.g., mental health [30]), there is a gap in knowledge about the specificity and frequency of the types of responses that people receive when they disclose experiences of sexual abuse online. Additionally, prior work does not provide insights about what features of posts elicit different types of responses (e.g., support, reciprocal disclosures, unsupportive responses). Finally, the role of anonymity in responses to disclosures of sexual abuse remains unknown. In this article, we address these research gaps by examining sexual abuse disclosures on Reddit and the relationships between disclosure post content and the responses these posts receive, as well as the role of anonymity (provided by throwaway accounts) in these interactions. We also uncover circumstances in which people who ask for support receive or do not receive it from their online audience.
Addressing these gaps is important because people disclose highly intimate and stigmatized experiences online, sometimes for the very first time, and use online social technologies to communicate their need for support [6]. Yet, social technologies are not always equipped to best facilitate seeking and providing support around sensitive experiences. The type of response people receive to sensitive self-disclosures matters; thus, in this work we investigate what follows these disclosures. For commenters, providing support to posters may be a way to help themselves (as helper therapy principle suggests [90]) as well as the poster. Providing social support can also help build a more supportive and safe space for current, potential, or future members of the online community. Beyond understanding what post factors elicit what volume and kinds of responses (e.g., social support, aggressive and unsupportive, reciprocal disclosure), and how anonymity affects these interactions, this research also aims to help social media designers and moderators facilitate more supportive and useful interactions in online spaces through an empirical understanding of these response phenomena.
Our findings indicate that anonymity is key in seeking as well as providing support in stigmatized contexts. Additionally, we discuss how platforms that allow throwaway accounts and multiple accounts could explore design choices that may lead to higher volume of reciprocal disclosures, more meaningful support provisions, and an overall better user experience for those disclosing or responding to sensitive information. In what follows, we detail prior work, methods, and our results, then discuss implications that online platforms and technologists could use to facilitate support seeking and providing in stigmatized contexts such as sexual abuse. Among our findings, we show that (1) both matches and mismatches occur between the kinds of support sought by posters and the kinds of support provided by commenters, (2) higher degrees of commenter anonymity elicit more reciprocal disclosures in comments, and (3) higher degrees of anonymity by commenters are not significantly associated with negative and aggressive commentary.
LITERATURE REVIEW
In this section, we discuss the areas of prior work that informed this study, and describe how we combine and build from these research areas. We start by discussing online social support and reciprocal disclosures, then consider what we know about anonymity in online spaces and its functions in supporting stigmatized disclosures. Finally, we examine the previous literature about our context of interest: sexual abuse disclosures and reactions to them. By reviewing these previous bodies of work, we show how this article's examination of social support, reciprocity, and anonymity around responses to sexual abuse disclosures enables a new understanding of how to design online spaces to facilitate support in response to stigmatized disclosures.
Social Support and Reciprocal Self-Disclosures in Online Spaces
2.1.1 Social Support. One key form of responses to disclosures, especially to stigmatized disclosures is through social support communication. Social support is one outcome of disclosure, and moderates the relationship between abuse disclosure and mental health [24,106]. In fact, research suggests that disclosure on its own is not associated with improved mental wellbeing; it is having supportive friends, family, and partners that reduces the discloser's risk of mental health challenges like depression, anxiety, and suicide ideation [24]. Negative responses to disclosures harm the discloser's wellbeing [107]. For example, unsupportive responses from partners or close contacts are associated with lower levels of psychological adjustment for survivors of rape [28].
Social Support, Reciprocity, and Anonymity in Responses to Sexual Abuse Disclosures 28:5
When disclosure confidants are not supportive, survivors of abuse are more likely to suffer from dissociation and self-denigration [36].
Support groups and forums consist of people sharing a life stressor, challenge, or stigmatized identity facet coming together to exchange mutual support, and are an important means for people to improve wellbeing. These groups can be in-person or online. Literature on in-person support groups suggests many benefits of participation, including validation, ""normalization"" of experience (by helping members see that there are others in their situation and that for people in their situation, their experiences are ""normal""), reduced isolation, increased sense of belonging, and enhanced self-esteem [74]. A large body of prior work has established that online communities, also, enable people to seek and provide support surrounding a variety of experiences such as but not limited to cancer, mental health, diabetes, or alcohol and drug abuse [26,46,94,112]. Sometimes people seek specific advice and informational support, and other times they seek sympathy or other types of responses when they participate in online support communities [7,46,82]. Similar to in-person contexts, online support is a contributing factor in reducing depression and improving self-efficacy and quality of life [86]. A study of comments associated with posts about suicidal ideation on Reddit showed that linguistic features of specific kinds of support (i.e., esteem and network) tend to reduce one's risk of suicidal ideation as expressed in Reddit posts in a future time [22]. This literature shows that the social support provided in online spaces can be helpful.
In this article, we employ the Social Support Behavioral Code [27] as a categorization schema to characterize the nature of support being provided via online comments. This schema includes informational support (providing information or advice), instrumental (tangible) support (express willingness to help in a tangible way or actually do so such as offer to talk to someone or do something for them), esteem support (communicating respect and confidence in abilities by acts such as complimenting one), network support (communicating belonging to a group of people with similar experiences), and emotional support (communicating empathy, love, or concern). We used this framework in the first phase of this project [6] as well, where we identified the different types of support people sought in posts. This framework has also been used in other past work studying social support in online spaces [7,22,26]. This way of characterizing social support through a formal framework (rather than more generic forms such as only emotional support and advice) is helpful not only because it provides a detailed perspective, but also because it adds to the conceptual clarity of the social support phenomena in the literature and facilitates future comparisons between empirical investigations in different contexts and communities.
Mismatches between the types of support people seek and the support they receive is an important aspect of social support exchange. Different people prefer different types of support, and not all types of support provided in online spaces are necessarily helpful [103]. According to the Optimal Matching Model of Stress and Social Support, social support is most effective if it matches the individual's needs [74]. As such, when people seek support online, examining whether they found the support they sought is important, and partially speaks to the utility of participating in these spaces. In fact, receiving the social support that matches one's needs and preferences leads to improvements in psychological adjustment, efficacy, ability to cope with distressing events, resistance to illness, recovery from illness, and life expectancy [19,74]. Self-disclosure in an online health support group enables people to make their emotional needs known, which often leads to them receiving emotional support; similarly, asking questions makes informational needs known, leading to informational support [111]. This provides evidence that the types of support people desire can influence the types of support they receive [111]. However, mismatches still occur, and it is important to investigate both matches and mismatches in support types sought and received, particularly because those who receive optimal support are more likely to remain in and contribute to an online community [111,112]. In this article, we investigate the relationship between the types of support sought and provided, to identify and address support matches and mismatches. We also identify which support types are sought or provided together.
The previous literature on social support in online spaces leads us to the following research questions that are directly concerned with social support in the form of comments in response to sensitive disclosures:
RQ1. What types of comments do abuse-related posts elicit?
RQ2. What characteristics of posts are related to comment volume? RQ3. How is the type of support sought in posts related to the type of support provided in comments, and what types of support co-occur in posts and comments? 2.1.2 Reciprocal Self-Disclosure. Reciprocity of self-disclosure is closely related to the notion of response in the disclosure process; reciprocal disclosures happen when one individual shares some information, and the other reciprocates with information with a similar intimacy level. The occurrence of reciprocal self-disclosure is one of the most consistent findings of laboratory selfdisclosure studies in dyadic and in-person contexts [33,64]. In computer-mediated contexts, research suggests that people may over-interpret the intimacy level of self-disclosures and reciprocate with more intimate disclosures compared to face-to-face settings [57]. Andalibi and Forte [5] showed how reciprocal disclosures occur at the network-level (rather than dyadic) through social media posts, and introduced the concept of network-level reciprocal disclosure. Network-level reciprocal disclosure refers to disclosures that occur on social media not in response to any particular disclosure (as would be the case, for example, in dyadic non-computer-mediated settings, or social media comments) but in response to less perceived stigma associated with disclosure [5]. While comments in online spaces provide an opportunity for reciprocal disclosures in response to the poster's initial disclosure, we do not know much about the conditions under which reciprocal self-disclosures occur on social media through comments. Exploring reciprocal disclosures in stigmatized contexts on social media is important because reciprocity may not only help the original poster or others reading feel less alone and more supported, but may also enable the commenter to engage in a disclosure that they may not have felt comfortable initiating. In the context of our study, we are therefore interested in understanding if commenters may share their own stories after reading a poster's disclosure. Drawing on the social science literature, we frame these kinds of responses as reciprocal disclosures and investigate the role of post disclosure content as well as the anonymity of posters and commenters in the occurrence of reciprocal disclosures in comments, and ask the following research questions:
RQ4. What types of posts elicit comments that include reciprocal disclosures? RQ5. Are reciprocal disclosures more likely to come from throwaway commenter accounts?
Anonymity in Online Spaces
Anonymity is a complicated construct when it comes to online spaces. A dominant ideology across academia and the public at large posits that online anonymity is inherently dangerous; an argument that has been challenged by scholars such as Froomkin [41]. On the one hand, research suggests that anonymity could lead to hurtful and negative interactions [102]. On the other hand, scholars have also found that opportunities for anonymity are key for those who may not feel safe to participate in online spaces in the context of personal and often stigmatized experiences (e.g., [6,69]) or in broader contexts such as contributing to open collaboration projects [39]. In summary, prior research has linked anonymity to both positive and negative outcomes, some of which we discuss in this section.
Positive outcomes of anonymity include the ability for people to seek support, and even build community, around sensitive and stigmatized topics. Researchers have linked anonymity to more disinhibition in online spaces [11,55,102]. Higher disinhibition resulting from more anonymity can in turn facilitate disclosing stigmatizing experiences (e.g., [7,35,68,94]), or seeking direct and indirect support [6]. For example, anonymity on Ask.fm allows adolescents to feel more authentic, circumvent social expectations, learn about themselves, manage identity and self-presentation, and initiate and develop relationships [35]. For people who have experienced traumatic experiences such as pregnancy loss, helpful anonymous participation on platforms such as Reddit may lead to future disclosures to known audiences on identified contexts, such as Facebook [5]. Some populations appreciate anonymity to the extent that they create anonymous spaces on Facebook, even though the site enforces ""real name policies"" and does not support anonymity. For example, on Class Confessions pages, first generation or low socioeconomic status college students are able to anonymously post about socio-economic and poverty-related challenges through moderators [89] or discuss other taboo topics [15]. Moderated anonymity enables Facebook Class Confession pages' success [89]; while posters can be anonymous, commenters must use their Facebook identities to interact with the posts, can be held accountable, and can provide support to the posters [89]. Class Confessions is a unique example of an online community that uses a hybrid model of anonymity for posters (to seek support) and identifiability for commenters (to provide support). In our article, we extend this body of work by investigating what happens when both commenters and posters can choose to be more or less anonymous, and focus on one stigmatized context to explore this question.
Yet anonymity has also been linked to negative outcomes. More disinhibition and anonymity could lead to less accountability and hurtful behaviors [102], while ""real names"" have been suggested to help promote accountability and trust [77]. Some of the documented negative outcomes associated with anonymity include cyberbullying [12,13,65], trolling [31], hostile commenting [63], deception [52], or decrease in credibility or making communication impersonal [54,85].
Focusing solely on commenting behavior, research has examined the impact of anonymity on commenting behavior on discussion boards or news articles. For example, those commenting with a ""real name"" social network account may be less likely to use offensive words in comparison with those using pseudonymous-more anonymous compared to ""real names""-accounts [21]. ""Real name"" commenting on news articles has also been found to lead to more civil discussions, and discussions that directly engaged with the topic rather than with the text's author [40]. Yet other researchers found that anonymous users were quantitatively more engaged in discussion boards; however, outside observers perceived the discussion quality to be higher when users were not able to be more anonymous [88].
The literature reviewed here suggests that higher degrees of anonymity may have both positive and negative outcomes. The potential role of various levels of anonymity in the types of responses to disclosures of stigmatized experiences on social media is a research gap that we address.
In this article, we investigate the role of anonymity in responding to disclosures about stigmatized experiences. This is an important phenomenon because, as we discussed, those with stigmatized experiences often face challenges in disclosing their feelings and thoughts, and when they do disclose, responses to those disclosures are key to their wellbeing. Social computing systems can be designed to allow people to disclose stigmatized experiences, and seek and provide support, and with our article we contribute to this larger design goal. On Reddit, while all accounts can be pseudonymous and thus anonymous to some extent, throwaway accounts are used as a proxy for more anonymity [66]. Prior work in the context of mental health suggests that throwaway posts are more disinhibited [83]. In the context of abuse disclosures, in the first phase of this study, we established that posts from throwaway accounts are associated with more indirect and direct support seeking [6]. We extend this work by investigating how support provision and other kinds of responses to disclosures differ between throwaway and identified commenter and poster accounts; in other words, here we investigate the role of anonymity in responses to stigmatized disclosures via the following research questions:
RQ6. What characteristics of posts and comments are associated with throwaway commenter accounts? RQ7. Are aggressive or unsupportive comments more likely to come from throwaway commenter accounts?
Sensitive Disclosures and Responses to Them
Self-disclosure refers to sharing information about one's self with others [47], a process that involves navigating the boundary between safely concealing information and making one's self vulnerable by sharing that information. Sometimes people engage in self-disclosure to find others who share similar stigmatized identity facets online and offline. Self-disclosure in sensitive settings can sometimes lead to benefits such as receiving support [7,20], yet other times it leads to negative consequences such as rejection and being more stigmatized [14,16,70,108]. In the remainder of this section, we first synthesize what prior work teaches us about sensitive disclosures in online settings. We then move on to discuss the literature on disclosures of and responses to sexual abuse specifically, first in non-computer-mediated and dyadic contexts, then in computer-mediated contexts. Finally, we describe how our work contributes to this domain.
Sensitive Disclosures on Social Media.
People often face difficulty disclosing sensitive information in online settings. In some cases, sensitive information (e.g., disease diagnoses, abuse, depression, pregnancy loss) involve stigma and can be prohibitively painful to share with even the closest of friends. A stigmatized identity is socially devalued and associated with negative beliefs [44]. For example, those in military cultures often experience stigma and barriers to disclosing struggles they may face [34,97,98]. Yet they sometimes do disclose difficult and stigmatized experiences on social media, often to highly selective audiences [34], and often as a result of observing others who have set aside the non-disclosure norms often associated with military culture [97]. Women who experience pregnancy loss often experience stigma and make complicated decisions to engage in disclosures on social media. These decisions involve balancing potentially conflicting needs (e.g., support and privacy) and are informed by a variety of factors related to the self, audience, society, network, temporality, and platform affordances [5]. Similarly, disclosures of transgender identity on Facebook are associated with increased stress, though support from one's network mitigates some of this stress [50]. For disadvantaged first year college students, though social network sites are an important space for identity work, this population also encounters barriers to information sharing given stigma and fear of judgement [80]. Anonymous platforms would allow such students to ask questions and receive much-needed informational support without reputation concerns [80]. Other populations such as parents also face disclosure challenges. For example, they may be concerned about expressing parenthood's difficulties, and sometimes access social support via more anonymous spaces or support groups to avoid the judgments and stigma they may experience otherwise [1,95]. Those with higher impression management concerns tend to disclose less personal information on Facebook, as do those with larger and less dense networks [110].
People engage in many strategies to combat some of these difficulties and manage information disclosure in networked environments. For instance, many choose to self-censor content on Facebook, due in part to impression management concerns [100], and some engage in indirect disclosure strategies or complete non-disclosure [3]. On social network sites that include one's ""real life"" network, disclosure can be collaborative rather than individual [62,71]; yet social network sites often lack collaborative tools and means for preventive disclosure management [62]. Circles on Google+ allowed users to navigate sharing to different audiences and engage in more selective sharing across different life facets, ties with varying strength, and interest-based groups [60], as do friend ""lists"" on Facebook, with varying success [37]. Platforms like Reddit and Tumblr address some information disclosure issues in part by allowing anonymity and pseudonymity, and in part by enabling boundary regulation by being separate from one's ""real life"" network [49].
Disclosure and anonymity are, of course, closely related to privacy. Privacy and disclosure are both dynamic processes that people wish to have control over, but sometimes do not [58]. The Internet changed both demands to disclose personal information, and the implications of disclosing [58]. While we acknowledge the importance and relevance of privacy research, a full review of privacy literature is beyond the scope of this article.
Disclosures of Sexual
Abuse. The literature on dyadic sexual abuse disclosure in noncomputer-mediated contexts has established the importance of disclosures, challenges in disclosure and healing, and responses to disclosures. The disclosure of sexual abuse is an ongoing process including three phases: self-realization and understanding; confidant selection, disclosure, and reaction, in which the discloser receives a positive or negative response; and consequences of that disclosure such as receiving social support and improved emotional wellbeing, that inform future disclosure strategies [101]. Research suggests that reactions to sexual abuse disclosures in dyadic contexts depend on factors such as whether disclosure happens in childhood or adulthood, to whom and how it is disclosed, and how much information is disclosed [107]. These studies suggest that both the initial disclosure and responses to it are parts of the ongoing disclosure process and are interconnected.
It is common for disclosures of abuse to be delayed. A majority of sexual assaults occur prior to adulthood, yet individuals are more likely to not disclose their experiences until they are adults [59,61]. Disclosure delays, as well as self-blame and negative reactions, are associated with higher post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms [105]. Many child sexual abuse survivors do not disclose to their parents, often due to fear and shame, and those who do disclose are likely to receive angry or blaming responses",5956,6882

Aside from #MeToo and similar campaigns, sexual assault survivors use social media to disclose personal experiences. This paper uses a mixed-methods approach and draws on network ethnography (Howard, 2002) to explore the visibility of these 'everyday' sexual assault disclosures and how such disclosures further survivors' disclosure motivations. Social network analysis of 23 Twitter hashtags related to sexual assault shows minimal engagement with disclosive tweets, while interviews with survivors (N = 27) indicate that hashtagged disclosures can result in impactful interactions with other survivors, particularly via less visible social media channels, such as direct messages. In combination, results suggest (1) that survivor networks can and do form around mundane hashtags, and (2) that highly visible hashtagged disclosures act as beacons to other survivors and are employed in pursuit of motivations such as supporting other survivors and challenging stigma associated with sexual assault.
",2021-08-07,"Information, Communication & Society",Informa UK Limited,"Introduction
Recent social media campaigns, such as #MeToo and #NotOkay, have attempted to raise awareness of sexual assault (SA) and promote social justice for SA survivors in the United States (Bogen et al., 2018;Provenzano, 2017, october 16). These campaigns emphasize disclosures of personal assault experiences to highlight the prevalence of SA, destigmatize SA, and increase compassion for survivors. They also provide evidence that highly visible hashtag campaigns can encourage networked disclosure. This study explores how SA survivors use 'everyday' hashtags (e.g., #SexualAssault) in disclosure and how such tags similarly support reciprocated disclosure.
Disclosure, the act of revealing personal information (Omarzu, 2000), is a strategic communicative act informed by complex decisions about to whom, how much, and for what purpose to disclose. A risk-reward tension is central to disclosure decision-making, as disclosing sensitive or stigmatized information can carry risks, including personal safety and security, embarrassment, relational effects, and stigma (Petronio, 2002). Blame and judgment are particularly salient risks in SA contexts (Hoover & Morrow, 2015;Ullman, 1996). Social stigmatization of SA, which often pressures survivors to stay silent, internalize blame for assault, and to not pursue justice or accountability through formal channels (i.e., reporting to police), further informs these risks (Ahrens, 2006;Deitz et al., 2015;Edwards et al., 2011;Ullman, 1999). These risks may be heightened online, as women and marginalized communities are often targets of harassment on social media (Dhrodia, 2018;Vera-Gray, 2017). Thus, being visible on social media may increase one's vulnerability to harm as a result of stigma disclosure.
Disclosure motivations, however, counter disclosure risks. Sexual assault survivors disclose for myriad reasons, including seeking social support (Ullman, 1999), processing trauma, educating others (Ahrens et al., 2007), supporting other survivors (Bogen et al., 2018), and seeking justice (Powell, 2015). Social media afford unique communicative opportunities and abilities (O'Sullivan & Carr, 2018;Treem & Leonardi, 2012) instrumental in disclosure and healing. Being visible on social media, for instance, may facilitate social connection (Furr et al., 2016); finding similar others (Rains & Wright, 2016), a mechanism of social support (Thoits, 2011); and destigmatization (Andalibi, 2019) in ways not easily replicable offline. These potential benefits make social media a compelling site for disclosure.
Social media support visibility through characteristics, including 'masspersonal' communication (O'Sullivan & Carr, 2018), a broad and largely invisible audience (Litt, 2012), and interactivity with user-generated content (Carr & Hayes, 2015). Similarly, social media afford control over disclosure visibility through additional features, such as privacy settings and hashtags; visibility may be strategically managed (e.g., increased, decreased) to facilitate disclosure motivations and temper perceived disclosure risks (Pearce et al., 2018). The sociomaterial context of social media is an ideal space in which to examine stigmatized disclosure through the lens of visibility as social media affordance.
This study draws on network ethnography (Howard, 2002) methods to lend nuance to both results of social network analysis (SNA) of Twitter hashtags related to SA and insights from qualitative interviews with self-identified SA survivors (N = 27). I argue that 'everyday' hashtagged disclosures are generative, in terms of supporting other survivors, fostering reciprocated disclosure, and destigmatizing SA. In isolation, SNA results, which indicate that a high percentage of disclosive tweets are isolates and receive limited to no visible engagement (e.g., retweets, comments) from others, suggest that survivors may be unsuccessful in meeting these motivations. Interviews supplement these findings and indicate that survivors leverage social media affordances and communicative channels to seek similar others and engage in meaningful conversations and social support exchanges that are not publicly visible. In this way, hashtagged disclosures act as beacons, indicators to similar others, rather than bridges, or key connectors within traceable social media networks. This article thus contributes a mixed-methods analysis of stigmatized disclosure visibility and highlights the need to consider multiple communicative channels in analyzing networked and reciprocated disclosure.
Interview insights show that supporting similar others and destigmatizing sexual assault are prominent, intertwined motivations that inform visible disclosures of sexual assault. While a full analysis of disclosure motivations shared in interviews is beyond the scope of this paper, the included findings (1) provide evidence that social media supports the pursuit of multiple, simultaneous motivations, and (2) suggest that 'beacon' disclosures may be motivated by a desire to support others more than to receive support.
Literature review
Scholarship on sexual assault as a stigmatized experience, dialectical perspectives of disclosure, and social media affordances inform this study. In the following sections, I review key concepts before presenting the questions guiding the study.
I define 'sexual assault' as any attempted or completed sexual act perpetrated against someone without their consent (Basile et al., 2014). Sexual assault is thus an umbrella term that includes rape and attempted rape, other non-consensual sexual activities. This definition collapses numerous contexts of violence and flattens differences and considerations that distinguish, for instance, dating violence from child sexual abuse. In the larger project of which this data is a part, however, an individual self-identifying as having experienced SA was sufficient; focusing on distinctions between categories of assault potentially exposes participants and readers to unnecessary risks, including trivialized accounts of trauma.
While people of all genders can experience SA, women are disproportionately affected; an estimated 43% of women experience some form of sexual violence in their lifetime, compared to 25% of men (Smith et al., 2018). Beyond gender, factors including race and sexual orientation also influence risk; for example, an estimated 55% of American Indian women and nearly 75% of bisexual women experience sexual violence other than rape in their lifetime (Breiding et al., 2014;Smith et al., 2018). Sexual assault affects survivors differently, and some may feel either equipped to 'handle it' without assistance or not particularly affected by encounters that meet the definition for assault (Starzynski et al., 2007). For others, SA can result in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and otherwise negatively affect physical, psychological, and emotional well-being (Ullman & Siegel, 1995).
Feminist and advocacy-informed understandings of SA emphasize that SA is a crime of power and control, rather than sex, where one's autonomy is violated (Nicolaidis & Paranjape, 2009). This framing situates SA as a choice made by a perpetrator of violence, and contrasts with social stigmatization of SA, which often blames victims for violence perpetrated against them (Deitz et al., 2015). I use the term 'survivor' throughout this paper to reject 'the status quo view of [survivors] as perpetual victims' (Hockett & Saucier, 2015, p. 10), and instead emphasize how survivors, who disclose on social media, view disclosure as a means of reclaiming power. 'Survivor' also reflects interview participants' preferred labels, except where noted (Hockett & Saucier, 2015). (References to 'victim' in crime statistics and in direct quotations are exceptions.) I highlight the centrality of power and vulnerability in SA to draw parallels to the roles of power, vulnerability, and control in disclosure and visibility, discussed in the next sections.
Sexual assault disclosure
Disclosure is a strategic act by individuals in an attempt to 'control their social worlds and achieve their social and personal goals' (Omarzu, 2000, p. 174). Dialectical perspectives on disclosure emphasize that disclosure involves tensions between opposing forces, such as concealing and revealing information, that ultimately shape if and how disclosure occurs (Dindia, 1998;Petronio, 2002). Revealing information requires relinquishing privacy and control over that information (as what is said can't be 'unsaid'; Petronio, 2002). Individuals may evaluate the risks and benefits of disclosure to assess the vulnerability associated with revealing particular information to a particular audience (Petronio, 2002). Disclosure is thus a goal-oriented behavior informed by assessing likely outcomes.
Disclosure risks
Risk categories broadly associated with disclosure include security (personal safety, loss of power), stigma, 'face risks' (embarrassment), and role risks (relational turbulence) (Petronio, 2002). Loss of control and personal autonomy are also disclosure risks (Omarzu, 2000) and further underscore the tension between disclosure and vulnerability. In SA disclosure, more specifically, the risk of negative reactions (blame, disbelief, etc.) is a particularly impactful factor in determining if and to whom one discloses (Ahrens, 2006;Hoover & Morrow, 2015;Ullman, 1996). Social stigmatization of SA survivors further informs this risk.
Stigma refers to an undesirable attribute that marks an individual as deviant in some way from a social standard and serves to discredit that individual (Goffman, 1963). Concealable stigma refers to a discrediting attribute that is not visibly apparent, or that can generally be hidden from others (Dindia, 1998). Sexual assault can generally be considered a concealable stigmatized experience; disclosure makes this experience visible and potentially increases one's vulnerability to social enforcement of norms via shaming, judgment, self-blame, and social isolation (Chaudoir & Fisher, 2010). Cultural stereotypes and myths that position SA victims as complicit in deserving of assault or otherwise discreditable (Edwards et al., 2011), as well as experienced social stigma, inform SA stigma (Deitz et al., 2015). Self-blame may be particularly influential in perpetuating stigma and shaming of SA victimization; Deitz et al. (2015) found a positive association between self-stigma and trauma symptom severity. Stigma can thus affect one's physical experience of trauma and willingness to disclose in order to seek treatment or other resources (Ullman, 1999).
Disclosure benefits and motivations
In contrast to risks, benefits that motivate disclosure broadly include reduced anxiety, social support receipt, and increased relational intimacy (Dindia, 1998). Sexual assault disclosure research emphasizes help-seeking motivations, such as social support seeking and finding community, as particularly salient (Ahrens et al., 2007;O'Neill, 2018;Ullman, 1996Ullman, , 1999)). Social support, or 'the things people say and do for one another' (Goldsmith, 2004, p. 3), is at once a resource and a means of securing resources, including informational (advice, teaching), emotional (affection, empathy), esteem (validation, relief of blame), tangible (direct tasks, material goods), and social network support (presence, access, and companions; Cutrona & Suhr, 1992). Different support providers may provide different types of support. For example, social support from experientially similar others (i.e., other SA survivors) may validate a survivor's experiences, assist in processing, and otherwise 'enhance a victim's ability to find meaning in the experience' (Thoits, 2011;Ullman, 1999, p. 345), which potentially facilitate the unlearning of self-stigma and further recovery.
Research highlighting social support seeking as a SA disclosure motivation often considers dyadic contexts (e.g., Dindia, 1998;Ullman, 1999) or experientially similar others, such as those found on Reddit forums, as audience (e.g., Ahrens et al., 2007;O'Neill, 2018). Work addressing stigma disclosure on social media more broadly (e.g., Andalibi & Forte, 2018), surfaces a range of other-focused motivations, such as raising awareness, educating others, and providing support; seeing others disclose may also encourage networked, or reciprocal, disclosure. These findings underscore where and to whom one discloses as influential considerations and suggest that social media may enable disclosure motivations differently than offline contexts.
Social media
Social media are Internet-based, 'masspersonal' communication channels (characterized by aspects of both mass and interpersonal communication; O'Sullivan & Carr, 2018) that support interaction between users and the creation/sharing of user-generated content (Carr & Hayes, 2015). The term 'social media' cements the importance of interactivity and considers audience as extending beyond explicitly networked connections (e.g., followers). Public social media affords visibility beyond visibility to connections, though most social media content is 'consumed by few' (Baym & boyd, 2012, p. 322). This conundrum calls into question the viability of social media as a tool for individuals to support similar but unspecific others through disclosure, as most visible, public content has limited range.
Interactivity on social media refers to the potential ability of a user to engage with other users' content (including posts, comments, and shared content; Carr & Hayes, 2015). The potential for interaction implicates audience as a component of social media; more specifically, it highlights the imagined audience, or 'mental conceptualization of the people with whom we are communicating' (Litt, 2012, p. 331), as well as their ability to react to disclosive content. The imagined audience is dynamic (e.g., multiple or shifting audiences), depending on the type of information being shared, and may be informed by evidence (e.g., likes, comments) of a user's active audience (Litt & Hargittai, 2016); behaviors afforded by social media sites (Litt, 2012); and motivations for posting (Marwick & boyd, 2010). An affordance lens lends clarity to how people manage risks, pursue motivations, and target their imagined audience(s) on social media.
Affordances
The term 'affordances' refers to relationships between actors, technologies, and actions between them (Treem & Leonardi, 2012). Affordances are relational and arise from particular contexts, such that actors pursuing different goals may perceive different affordances from the same technology (Evans et al., 2017). Affordances, such as anonymity, persistence of content, and visibility, are not technological features, but perceived abilities that 'enable or constrain' behavioral outcomes (Evans et al., 2017, p. 36). Regarding social media disclosure, features such as hashtags may afford visibility, searchability, and association (Treem & Leonardi, 2012). I explore these connections in the following section.
Visibility
Visibility is the degree to which something is 'seeable' (Thompson, 2005). Offline and technologically mediated visibility share several dimensions that describe visibility as relational, outcome-oriented, and strategic (Pearce et al., 2018), as well as tied to vulnerability/power. These dimensions parallel similar attributes of disclosure. Visibility is relational, as it requires both an object to be seen and an actor to see it (Brighenti, 2010). Visibility is more often asymmetrical than symmetrical, such that reciprocity is 'always imperfect and limited' (Brighenti, 2010, p. 326); surveillance of one actor by another illustrates this dynamic. Visibility is strategic in that it may be manipulated in pursuit of a desired outcome; for example, one may increase disclosure visibility to reach a larger audience.
A tension exists, however, between strategic visibility as empowering and visibility as connected to vulnerability, in that one outcome does not exist without the other. Technologically mediated visibility further implicates vulnerability as it is impossible to fully regain control over information once it becomes visible (Thompson, 2005). Thus, visibility is a 'double-edged sword' for vulnerable or stigmatized individuals (Brighenti, 2007;Thompson, 2005).
On social media, visibility interacts with other affordances and properties of platforms (Thompson, 2005). Visibility is a 'root affordance' because it enables additional affordances (Flyverbom et al., 2016). For example, affordances such as searchability only become available after content becomes visible. Social media users may leverage a host of features and affordances to manage (i.e., increase, decrease) visibility, such as 'blocking' and friend lists (Vitak & Kim, 2014). Scholarship has explored the role of affordances in online disclosure (Bazarova & Choi, 2014;Vitak & Kim, 2014), including stigmatized identities (Andalibi, 2019) and visibility management (Flyverbom et al., 2016;Pearce et al., 2018). Scholarship has also explored the use of hashtags in sexual assault disclosure (Bogen et al., 2018;Maas et al., 2018). These works tend to focus on highly visible and activism-oriented campaigns, such as #MeToo, and lend support to destigmatizing SA as a motivation for disclosure. What remains to be seen, however, is how SA survivors leverage more mundane hashtags for disclosure beyond viral moments. This study contributes to this work by considering 'everyday' SA hashtags that may lack the visibility of viral hashtags (e.g., over one million Tweets used #NotOkay in 14 h; O'Brien, 2016).
As such, this study draws on analysis of SA-related hashtags and interviews with selfidentified SA survivors who have publicly disclosed on social media, to explore the central question: How do 'everyday' hashtags facilitate networked SA disclosure? More specifically, social network analysis (SNA) and interview analysis, respectively, respond to:
RQ1: What are the characteristics (e.g., network size, density) of user networks engaging with 'everyday' hashtagged SA disclosures on social media? RQ2: What motivations do survivors report for using 'everyday' hashtags on SA disclosure?
Methods
Data presented in this paper is part of a larger project that explores SA disclosure on social media through SNA and interviews. Procedurally, I conducted the SNA prior to interviews, though SNA data also facilitated purposive sampling of interview participants, consistent with network ethnography methods (Howard, 2002). This mixedmethods approach provided contextual nuance to findings.
Social network analysis
Social network analysis (SNA) provides a means of understanding key attributes of a social network. Hashtags segment larger networks into manageable samples of users and facilitate mapping specific topics across user networks. I selected 23 hashtags with slightly different orientations and connections to SA for inclusion. These orientations identity (e.g., #SexualAssaultSurvivor), incident (e.g., #SexualAssault), and advocacy (e.g., #BelieveSurvivors)allowed a broader sampling of conversations around SA and consideration of multiple disclosure motivations and imagined audiences, including disclosure for support seeking, destigmatizing SA, and supporting other survivors. I scraped hashtags using NodeXL, an open-source Excel template that collects Twitter content and metadata, from July-September 2017. Of these 23 hashtags, seven tags returned no results with repeated sampling attempts (see Table 1).
Results show the total number of vertices (nodes/users), unique edges (connections between nodes), and duplicate edges (reiterated connections between nodes) to provide a sense of the size and activity of network(s) around each hashtag. I include network density as indicative of network interconnectivity (Kadushin, 2012); modularity as indicative of interconnectivity between network clusters (Himelboim et al., 2017); and isolates, or nodes without ties to others in the network, as further indicative of interactivity and connections within the network (Himelboim et al., 2017). I also report quantities of likes and retweets associated with a tweet at the time of scraping, as further indicative of interaction with disclosive hashtagged content.
As hashtags may be associated with myriad topics (Kosenko et al., 2019), I coded returned tweets as disclosive or non-disclosive; I present results for the entire network and identify disclosive content within these to contextualize engagement with these hashtags and to highlight disclosure within this engagement. I coded Tweets as disclosive if they clearly identified the poster as a SA or rape survivor; often, disclosive tweets included either declarative statements (e.g., 'I was raped #Rape') or statements that aligned the poster with survivorship (e.g., 'Four years ago I was almost broken, but now I'm strong #SexualAssaultSurvivor'). I also considered Tweets using multiple tags that, in combination, specified survivorship as disclosive (e.g., 'It's a new day! #SexualAssault #ImaSurvivor #SupportSurvivors'). News articles, support for survivors, or condemnations of SA that did not clearly identify the poster as a survivor were not considered disclosive (e.g., 'Cosby goes to trial: [link to news story] #BelieveSurvivors'). The popularity of hashtags varied widely at the time of collection; some queries returned four vectors, while others approached 2000 vectors.
Interviews
Twitter usernames associated with disclosive-coded content constituted a first round of recruitment for interviews (Howard, 2002); tags were also searched on Instagram and Tumblr for recruitment purposes. I contacted participants through the private messaging feature on the platform on which participants were identified. Messages included a brief description of the study and researcher's contact information. Following Campbell et al.'s (2009) recommendations, I created a website providing information about the study and researcher and included a link to the website in recruitment messages.
To be eligible to participate in interviews, participants were required to (1) be at least 18 years of age, (2) self-identify as a SA victim/survivor, (3) have posted publicly about personal assault experience(s) on social media, and (4) reside or attend school in the U.S. or Canada. Although gender identity was not a determining criterion for eligibility, the majority of participants identified as women and the experiences of female SA survivors are emphasized in this paper. The initial call for participation was generative but insufficient. Secondary recruitment involved re-searching identified hashtags on Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr, posting calls for participation on my social media profiles, and snowball sampling. I conducted additional recruitment rounds until I reached a final sample of 27 participants; a sense of saturation of themes also informed the sample size (Glaser & Strauss, 1967).
The sensitive nature of SA requires additional attention to issues such as participant privacy and the participant-researcher relationship. Qualitative research with SA survivors underscores the importance of conveying participants' experiences will be believed and met without judgment or blame (Campbell et al., 2009); my training as an anti-violence advocate further informed this imperative. Additionally, the inability to discern where someone is in their recovery process from their social media content necessitates attention to the privacy of potential participants. In practice, this included not contacting individuals unnecessarily and exercising discretion in accepting participants.
Interviews included a blend of open-ended prompts (e.g., 'Can you tell me about the first time you posted about SA on social media?') and exploratory/clarifying questions. Prompts asked participants to reflect on their social media use, engagement with different platforms, initial social media postings about SA, motivations/goals for posting, the audience(s) participants imagined engaging with their posts, and the impact of audience reactions on disclosure decisions. Some participants reported a lengthy history of disclosing/ discussing SA on social media and were unable to recall with certainty if the initial disclosure they described in the interview was actually their first online disclosure. This uncertainty, however, does not invalidate the participants' recollection. Petronio et al. (1996) address this limitation in their work with child sexual abuse survivors and argue that impactful events (such as disclosure) become cemented in memory, such that they are perhaps more available for recall, despite occurring months or years prior.
I reviewed the study and parameters of participation with each participant and obtained oral consent to participation and interview recording; institutional IRB approved the study design. All interview recordings were transcribed and analyzed using Dedoose, a qualitative analysis software; this enabled analysis of disclosure factors (e.g., motivations, audience, perceived risk) as informed by contextual factors (e.g., platform, affordances, visibility management). Template coding informed a coding scheme that reflected research questions and expected themes (Blair, 2015). Extant scholarship on SA and mediated disclosure informed initial codes, which were refined to include emergent categories (Lindlof & Taylor, 2011). Resultant codes focused on initial SA disclosures on social media, disclosure motivations, audience perceptions, reactions to disclosure, platforms used for disclosure, and social media features and affordances that shaped disclosure. In coding transcripts line-by-line, complete thoughts provided the unit of analysis (Strauss & Corbin, 1994).
Limitations
Both SNA and interview methods are limited in several ways. Hashtags are a discretionary feature, meaning hashtag networks are not generalizable to other contexts (Tufekci, 2014). Hashtags may also be used in reference to multiple issues or perspectives on an issue (Kosenko et al., 2019). Furthermore, the hashtags included in this study are not comprehensive and, despite association with disclosure during tag selection, may not ultimately represent the most popular SA hashtags at the time. Analysis is limited by what platforms make available and how user networks are structured. Twitter has a free and public API, though only a fraction of content is scrapable or collectible (Smith et al., 2010). Date restrictions also apply, such that only content from 8 to 9 days prior to scraping is available and will be collected (Smith et al., 2010). Resultant networks are thus merely snapshots of dynamic conversations. Interview responses may overemphasize the opinions of survivors who perceived fewer risks associated with visible disclosure and participating in research. As participant selection was partly based on identification of hashtagged disclosures, this study may overemphasize the viability of hashtags as a means of community-building and social support exchange.
Results

Social network analysis
Results respond to RQ1, lend insight into the disclosive utility of certain hashtags, and provide a baseline level of engagement with disclosive tweets. Identity-oriented tags appeared more often in connection to disclosive content than incident-and advocacy-oriented tags (with #SexualAssault a notable exception). Within the identity-oriented category, tags indicating survivorship, such as #SexualAssaultSurvivor and #RapeSurvivor, appeared in connection with disclosure more often than victim identity-oriented tags (#RapeVictim, #SexualAssaultVictim). In contrast, incident-oriented tags appeared less utilized (three tags returned no results) for disclosure, with the exception of #SexualAssault.
The #SexualAssault network was one of the largest considered; its association with disclosure could be attributed to the frequency of use and topical specificity. Advocacyoriented tags appear less specific to SA, as they tend to address issues, such as stigma and consent, pertinent to myriad identities and contexts. Tags such as #SupportSurvivors appear used by SA advocacy and resource organizations, which may also affect disclosure. That is, organizations' use of masspersonal channels such as Twitter may eliminate the need for survivors seeking support to disclose and self-identify in order to benefit from such resources. While this specific relationship between visible advocacy/support and disclosure as help-seeking is beyond the scope of this paper, these findings suggest that organizations may effectively leverage the visibility afforded by hashtags to provide resources without necessitating survivors to request resources via disclosure.
Regarding disclosive tweets in hashtag networks, it is both significant and unsurprising that the majority of disclosive tweets were isolated and/or received low levels of visible engagement (i.e., likes, retweets, and comments/replies). These findings mirror those in scholarship addressing interaction with disclosive content on platforms such as Tumblr, where users are more likely to favorite and reblog posts than leave comments (Alrajebah et al., 2018). That said, users' motivations for disclosure inform the perceived impact of and the satisfaction derived from audience feedback (French & Bazarova, 2017); interaction (or lack thereof) may be assessed differently by a survivor disclosing to seek support than by a survivor disclosing to document their experience.
The prominence of disclosive isolates is additionally significant in an optical sense. Considered alone, isolates suggest that 'everyday' hashtagged disclosures may not be conducive to networked disclosure. In combination with interview insights, however, I argue that such isolates are not indicative of stalled conversations, but rather highlight the need to expand consideration of interaction beyond immediately visible metrics.
The following sections explore supporting other survivors as a motivation for disclosure, the deliberate use of hashtags to target this imagined audience, and participants' reflections on connections forged via less visible communication channels, such as private messages.
Supporting others as disclosure motivation
While a full account of disclosure motivations is beyond the scope of this paper, interview findings respond to RQ2 and suggest that supporting others and destigmatizing SA motivated visible disclosures using 'everyday' hashtags.
Consistent with stigma disclosure scholarship (e.g., Andalibi & Forte, 2018), interview participants relayed myriad motivations for disclosing. While SA research highlights social support seeking as a disclosure motivation (e.g., Ullman, 1999), interviews suggest that supporting others is a more prominent motivation for visible, public social media disclosure using 'everyday' hashtags. That said, social support needs did inform some participants' social media disclosures. As P14 commented, 'I wasn't really getting the support I needed locally. So basically, for the last few months I've really been using social media just as a place for people to connect.' Similarly, P16 began disclosing online after their therapist advised them to 'be what you need' when they were frustrated by a lack of helpful resources. P10 explained, 'I try to use social media as like, 'I'm here if you need to talk. I'm here with the resources.' And mainly like, 'You're not alone.'' In these cases, disclosure stemmed from a personal need for support, but manifested as also seeking to support others through connection and sharing mutually beneficial resources.
Supporting others was also related to the motivation of challenging stigma and isolation associated with being a sexual assault survivor; posts addressing this facet of survivorship often emphasized the message that survivors 'want people to feel like they're not alone' (6). Some participants expressed that simply being visible online as a survivor might support someone else. P20 noted, I just wanted people to know, you know, you can be strong. And I mean, even though I wasn't very stronglike I didn't feel like I was strong -I wanted to let people know that you can be. And there's still hope, you know. [X] months after I was assaulted, I went off to college and I'm still in college. So, I'm doing really well, and I feel that I've accomplished so much since then.
Importantly, being visible online does not necessitate being identified online. P19, for example, created an anonymous Tumblr with the express purpose of discussing their SA experiences:

This study sought to characterize disclosures of sexual victimization using the Twitter hashtag #NotOkay, which emerged before the 2016 presidential election. A random sample of 777 original English language tweets that contained the hashtag ''#NotOkay'' were garnered through NCapture software over a 5-day period. Content analysis was conducted using NVivo software. Only tweets that reflected personal disclosures of sexual victimization were included in the analysis. Disclosures included seven major themes pertaining to the characteristics of the assault(s), including (1) a description of the perpetrator;(2) type of assault; (3) age at the time of victimization; (4) location of the assault; (5) perpetrator tactics; (6) beliefs about why the assault occurred; and (7) the emotional impact on the victim. This study identified several common themes in the content of sexual assault disclosure on Twitter. Future research can explore whether social media is a cathartic platform for disclosure and how responses to disclosure on social media influence recovery following sexual victimization.
",2018-09,Violence and Gender,Mary Ann Liebert Inc,"Introduction
S exual violence-defined as any sexual act committed in the absence of freely given consent-is a pervasive public health problem (Black et al. 2011). Although most experiences of sexual victimization are not reported to the police (Paul et al. 2013), many survivors discuss their experience with someone they know and trust (Ahrens et al. 2009;Orchowski and Gidycz 2012). Communication Privacy Management (CPM) theory (Kennedy-Lightsey et al. 2012) has recently been applied by Pluretti and Chesebro (2015) to explain some of the factors that motivate how and to whom survivors of sexual victimization disclose their experience. Specifically, Pluretti and Chesebro highlight the impact of CPM theory on survivors' reported rationales for disclosing and worries during disclosure, and the impact of recipient response on outcomes of the disclosure. Importantly, in addition to the response of the disclosure recipient, regaining a sense of control over one's experience is a vital component of recovery following trauma (Frazier 2003). Survivors who disclose their experience often fear that their privacy will not be maintained (Ullman and Peter-Hagene 2014), or that they will be responded to negatively by a support provider (Orchowski et al. 2013a). Survivors who hold a high level of self-blame (Tillman et al. 2010) or internalized stigma surrounding sexual victimization are unlikely to talk with others about their experience (Miller et al. 2011). While some survivors may disclose to deliberately garner emotional support (Sorenson and Snow 1991), survivors may also be prompted to disclose by support providers who notice their distress (Ahrens et al. 2007), or as a result of conversations or educational programs that address genderbased violence (Karen et al. 1999;Paine and Hansen 2002).
Online forums and social media communities offer a novel opportunity for understanding the content of sexual assault disclosure, as disclosures that occur within these spaces are documented and preserved. Social media sites are widely used as platforms for sharing personal experiences (Fawcett and Shrestha 2016;Weathers et al. 2016) and engaging in public discourse (Cravens et al. 2015;Yang 2016). To the authors' knowledge, Moors and Webber's (2012) descriptive analysis of disclosure of sexual victimization on a Yahoo! Answers thread is the only study to date that examines the content of sexual assault disclosure in an online forum. While this study adds to the literature by describing the relationship between discloser and respondent in this online space, the study is limited by its focus on a relatively small sample of individuals (n = 32), who were specifically seeking help through the online forum. Given that not all disclosure is for the purpose of seeking help (Ahrens et al. 2007), research is needed to understand how survivors disclose outside of formal help-seeking contexts. In addition, Fawcett and Shrestha (2016) completed a thematic analysis of 30 blog posts written by sexual violence survivors. While this critical analysis expanded current knowledge of sexual assault disclosure in online forums, sample size was limited, and discussion focused on three emergent themes-aftermath of abuse, the need for support, and helping others. Therefore, more research is needed to explore the content of what survivors say when they disclose, and how disclosure on a forum such as Twitter may differ from disclosures facilitated through personal blogs.
Twitter is an online social media site created in 2006 with over 313 million monthly users who read, post, and respond in short 140-character messages known as ''tweets'' (Twitter 2017). Although tweets often reflect personal content, the use of a ''hashtag'' in a tweet can link an individual to a larger online community, allowing for community narrative formation and information exchange (Yang 2016). Hashtags are defined by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2017) as ''a word or phrase preceded by the symbol # that classifies or categorizes the accompanying text (such as a tweet).'' The use of a hashtag on Twitter can be motivated by daily news events, or may also be called for by members of a community. Content analysis of popular Twitter hashtags therefore offers a rich opportunity to study the convergence of public and personal discourse as well as the process of community formation (Weathers et al. 2016). Although prior research documents how social media platforms open up spaces for disclosing experiences of domestic violence on Twitter (Cravens et al. 2015;Weathers et al. 2016), research has yet to examine how individuals disclose sexual victimization in this forum.
Twitter also provides a unique opportunity for users to interact with anonymity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not enforce a real name clause in user agreements. Instead, users adopt handles that mask identity and may choose not to share biographical, demographic, or personally identifying information (Fox et al. 2015). Online anonymity has contributed to the development of alternative cyber-psyches, as well as online communities that behave counter to normative social expectations (Suler 2004). The term online disinhibition effect has been coined to explicate the phenomena of users displaying behaviors online, which they would not typically perform in face-to-face interactions (Suler 2004).
A key tenet of the online disinhibition effect is dissociative anonymity, which allows individuals to minimize identity connection and distance online behaviors from the physical self (Fox et al. 2015). According to Zimmerman and Ybarra (2016), the anonymity provided online allows individuals to behave without fear of negative evaluation from others, and permits internet users to attempt new behaviors or mimic methods of self-expression that they see modeled online. Anonymity and online disinhibition may therefore impact Twitter users' willingness to disclose sensitive personal experiences.
#NotOkay: a call for disclosure of sexual victimization on twitter On October 7th, 2016, Canadian writer Kelly Oxford sent out a tweet calling on women to discuss their own experiences of sexual victimization on Twitter, writing: ''Women: tweet me your first assaults. They aren't just stats. I'll go first: Old man on city bus grabs my 'p-y' and smiles at me, I'm 12.'' In a second tweet, Kelly Oxford wrote: ''Women: keep tweeting me assaults with #NotOkay. Here was my second assault: Boy in drama class grabbed my 'pussy' during class, I was 13,'' which directed users to include the hashtag #NotOkay. Oxford's call for tweets followed the release of a 2005 audiotape recording from Access Hollywood that documented presidential candidate Donald Trump describing the use of celebrity status to garner sexual activity with women (e.g., ''when you're a star, they let you do it'') and statements that could be interpreted as perpetration of sexual aggression (''Grab them by the pussy.you can do anything'') (Fahrenthold 2016). Over one million tweets with the hashtag #NotOkay were written within 14 h, launching a social media community that addressed the intersection between personal experiences of sexual violence and the 2016 presidential election (Bush 2016;O'Brien 2016). The high number of tweets utilizing the hashtag #NotOkay during the 2016 presidential election offers a timely and unprecedented opportunity to examine the characteristics of sexual assault disclosure on social media. In this study, the authors sought to characterize disclosures of sexual victimization within a randomly selected subsample of tweets using the hashtag #NotOkay.
Methods

Data collection procedures, processing, and analysis plan
Tweets including the hashtag ''NotOkay'' were downloaded from Twitter using the NVivo addition NCapture. The hashtag #NotOkay trended on Twitter on October 10th, 2016. Data collection began on October 11th, 2016. Data were collected from Twitter from October 11th to October 20th. Data were collected at 4:15 PM on five nonconsecutive weekdays. This method ensured that data would be captured during hours of similar online traffic, to avoid bias by collecting on higher traffic weekends.
Data collection procedures followed the ethical merits of internet-based research using publicly available data (Eysenbach and Till 2001; Whitehead 2007). As NCapture collects only tweets that are available on Twitter's public API stream, this study was considered exempt from IRB approval and no formal informed consent process was required. NCapture allows researchers to gather the following data: Tweet ID, username, tweet text, time tweeted, tweet type (i.e., retweet or original content tweet), retweeted by, number of retweets, hashtags used, online mentions, name, location, web URL, user bio, number of user tweets, number of followers, and number of users following. Researchers collected only publicly accessible tweets and removed profile identifiers (i.e., username and profile description) and identifying information (i.e., geographic location, age, sex, relationship status, occupation, socioeconomic status, race, #NotOkay and religion), to maintain ethical standards of online data collection and protect user anonymity.
The initial dataset contained 2072 tweets. After removing irrelevant tweets, retweets, and non-English language tweets, the final dataset contained 777 original content tweets. For the purpose of this study, only tweets coded as disclosures were included in the analysis (n = 203). Researchers defined disclosures as any tweet that shared any type of sexual assault, abuse, or harassment experiencealong the continuum of violence-or identified the twitter user as a survivor themselves (an implicit disclosure of violence victimization). Interrater reliability in the identification of tweets that represented a disclosure was high, with a Cohen's kappa of 0.89 and a percent agreement of 97.6. To develop a nuanced codebook accounting for the dialogic, narrative form of tweets, coders followed Mayring's (2000) iterative content analysis procedures. These steps include (1) selecting units of analysis, (2) creating categories, and (3) establishing themes. Given the authors' knowledge of the extant literature, they concluded that a mixed inductive and preconstructed codebook allowed the team to be conscious of the preexisting frameworks they would bring to the data, while also leaving space for emergent themes. This methodology aligns with other content analyses of tweets (i.e., Cravens et al. 2015).
Specifically, the preliminary codebook was constructed based on iterative coding of the first 25% sample of tweets. Independent, open coding using NVivo software at project outset allowed three coders to individually establish underlying themes. Team members met throughout the coding process to assess relevance and validity of the preliminary codebook. Each of the themes was assessed for frequency, and any theme that occurred more than 10 times was retained. The final coding frame included seven major themes (Table 1). After establishing this codebook, the full sample of tweets was coded by two independent researchers.
Results
Character limits in tweets required that users condense the details of their assault experiences into 140 characters or less. Disclosures included assault characteristics (i.e., who, what, where, when, and how), beliefs about why victimization occurred, and a description of the aftermath of the assault. These themes were labeled as follows: (1) characteristics of the perpetrator; (2) type of assault; (3) age at the time of the assault; (4) location; (5) tactics utilized by the perpetrator; (6) beliefs about why the assault occurred; and (7) the emotional impact on the victim (Table 1). Some tweets included only one of the aforementioned disclosure characteristics, whereas others included up to six characteristics.
Characteristics of the perpetrator
Over half of tweets disclosing sexual victimization referenced some characteristic of the perpetrator (58%, n = 118), including age, gender, or their relationship to the victim. For example: ''I'm 16. My manager at a fast food chain pushes me against the wall with his pelvis to tell me it's my turn to mop. #NotOkay'' ''I was 14 when older distant relative creepily put his arm around me. Scared to death! Thank God my parents came home! #RapeCulture #NotOkay'' A description of the perpetrator often included reference to the power imbalance between the victim and perpetrator, whether through social position (i.e., a boss or religious leader) or family hierarchy (a father, an uncle, or other older, male family member). The majority of tweets that described the identity of the perpetrator described the attacker as someone known to the victim (54%, n = 64). 
Type of assault
Over 73% of the tweets conveying victimization experiences (n = 149) provided explicit descriptions of the type of victimization, commonly identifying which parts of their body were violated: ''#NotOkay 1st assault: 7 years old. friend of girlfriend's family 50-years-old man slipped finger inside my panties and rubbed my crotch. Gross.'' ''#NotOkay not just women-old guy grabbed my penis in the back of a musty used book store when i was 11 in a little town in missouri.'' Some individuals reprised Donald Trump's language from the Access Hollywood tapes to describe their abuse, describing experiences where they were also ''grabbed by the pussy.'' Other users drew connections between the language used by Trump and their own victimization experiences, without specifically mentioning Trump's campaign or candidacy:
''I was 12 when middle aged dude grabbed my pussy while I walked home from school. #lockertalk #sexualassault #NotOkay'' ''My first sexual assault was when I was quite young being grabbed BTP by one of my big brother's friends. Date rape +2 more rapes. #NotOkay'' Donald Trump's admission that he grabs women ''by the pussy'' was shortened into an acronym (i.e., BTP), potentially as a result of Twitter's 140-character limit.
Age at the time of the assault
Over half of tweets disclosing a victimization experience (55%) included the age at the time of the experience (n = 112). Many respondents indicated that they experienced sexual violence during childhood (before the age of 18), and that other assaults had occurred throughout the lifespan. For example, ''Scared to talk about this but it's TIME. Was raped at age 9 by [NAME]'s 1st son #NotOkay'' ''@kellyoxford Where do I begin? Started when I was 5, with my stepgrandfather touching me; ended when I was 12 #NotOkay'' Furthermore, of the 112 respondents who disclosed their age at the time of their victimization experience, 74% (n = 83) stated that they were younger than 18 years.
Location
A sizable number of disclosures (42%, n = 85) referenced where the victimization experience occurred. Some tweets reflected the isolation of the victim: ''#NotOkay I'm 20, hanging out with friends & boyfriend. I ask for aspirin. In bathroom the host grabs me & French kisses me. Stunned/silent'' ''party 13 yrs old asked where bathroom was male escorted me through bedroom-waited then tried to kiss and pushed onto bed. #NotOkay'' Tweets also reflected public victimization experiences, highlighting how perpetrators committed acts of violence in shared public spaces such as crowded subways and buses. In these situations, several users highlighted how onlookers failed to come to their aide. For example: ''#NotOkay I'm 17, leaving Rome. Customs agent grabs me 'a la Trump' during pat down. Everyone sees I protest. He smiles. Told to let it go'' Disclosure of abuse perpetrated in public spaces commonly referenced how a crowded space provided cover for the abuse to occur. The public nature of the crime was also perceived to exacerbate the impact of the crime, which was suffered in front of others who failed to intervene.
Beliefs about why the assault occurred Some tweets (11%, n = 22) offered a reason why the user believed they experienced sexual victimization. Tweets also linked sexual violence to other forms of oppression: ''I was 15 when my 18 y/o classmate said 'I can turn u straight' while getting on top of me and unzipping his pants. In class. #NotOkay'' ''A not stereotypically 'pretty' woman, I'm hit on anyway. Predators seem to think it's an easy win, or they're doing me a favor. #NotOkay''
The aforementioned responses highlight a belief among survivors that they were targeted potentially as a result of identifying with a marginalized group, or because they would be seen as an easy target. Tweets from other users also identified the perpetrators' desire to exert power and control as a potential reason for the assault. For example, ''@kellyoxford oh my God-I had blacked this one out-a group-'we have a right to you!' grabbed everything-I was 7 #NotOkay'' ''@kellyoxford He was waiting outside when we left. I was the 'bitch' that got him kicked out. #NotOkay'' As highlighted above, Twitter users described the role of misogyny, traditional gender role beliefs, and adversarial attitudes toward women in their experiences of sexual assault.
Tactics utilized by the perpetrator
Approximately one-third of disclosures described the tactics used by the perpetrator (34%, n = 69), including isolation, persistence, intimidation, grooming, coercion/ verbal pressure, physical force, and surprise. For example, ''#NotOkay guy jumps out of bushes w/gun in hand intent on rape. I was 13'' ''@kellyoxford Older man comes up behind me in an arcade in las vegas and rubs his penis against me. I'm 11 years old. #NotOkay'' Tweets highlighted a range of various perpetration tactics, including taking advantage of women who were too intoxicated to resist.
Emotional impact
One-third of respondents who disclosed sexual violence experiences (33%, n = 68) tweeted about the emotional aftermath of sexual victimization, including posttraumatic #NotOkay stress (e.g., nightmares and traumatic memories), as well as feelings of injustice and betrayal. Some users also shared that the #NotOkay tag itself was ''triggering,'' bringing them to reexperience traumatic memories. For example, ''@kellyoxford I can believe all the (terrible) memories that #NotOkay is bringing to the surface of my mind. So many bad things happened 2 me'' Other users shared that, although they would like to respond to the hashtag, their symptoms were too severe or debilitating for them to respond: ''#NotOkay that I would like to speak up, but I am too afraid and feel disgusted when remembering. And in one incident I was 12 years old.'' ''I can't. Partly cuz I think I was 1st abused b4 I can remember (2 yo), but also cuz it hurts too much. #NotOkay'' Recollections of assault were associated with feelings of fear, anger, sadness, self-blame, and rumination. Users also shared feeling that their assault or abuse experience was inescapable, and that such experiences had a lasting impact on both physical and psychological well-being: ''I remember every assault like it happened yesterday. It lives in my body. It takes up space. I remember. Do they?'' ''@kellyoxford Ages 5, 9, 15, 17, and 19. It's 20 years later & I am still struggling with the belief that they were my fault. #NotOkay'' Respondents also endorsed revictimization experiences, citing that they had experienced multiple assaults throughout the lifespan.
Discussion
This analysis of a random sample of tweets with the hashtag #NotOkay when disclosing sexual victimization in this space, survivors most frequently conceptualized their experience by telling others about the ''who, what, where, when, why'' and ''how'' of their assault(s). Due to Twitter's enforced 140-character limit, it is feasible that people who chose to disclose a victimization experience through Twitter were forced to prioritize the aspects of their assault or abuse that they found most vital to their experience.
The nature of the assault experience (73%) and age at the time of the assault (55%) were commonly disclosed. Kelly Oxford's call for disclosures included her own age at the time of the assault and the type of victimization. It is therefore possible that her tweet provided a template for other survivors disclosing their experiences through #Not-Okay. Her request to disclose first assault experiences may also have prompted users to disclose experiences of childhood sexual victimization. It was notable that the majority of tweets described the identity of the perpetrator as someone known to the victim. These disclosures help to debunk the myth that sexual assault is perpetrated by a stranger (Waterhouse et al. 2016). Approximately one-third of disclosure tweets (34%) referenced the tactics utilized by the perpetrator, and 11% indicated a reason the assault occurred. These reasons tended to focus on factors outside of the victim's control (e.g., race, ethnicity, and the perpetrator themselves). It is possible that these reasons may have been stated explicitly by the perpetrator, or reflected the survivor's own conceptualization of the experience. Notably, disclosure of sexual violence tends to be associated with attributing blame to the perpetrator (Starzynski et al. 2005). It is therefore possible that survivors who chose to disclose their victimization experiences through the #NotOkay tag had already processed their victimization experiences to the point at which they were able to assign blame to the perpetrator, or had already managed their own potential feelings of self-blame. With this in mind, it is likely that many more individuals who use Twitter experienced sexual violence than those who chose to disclose, and that the number of people who did not disclose their experiences using #NotOkay may have experienced higher self-blame than those who employed the tag as a tool of disclosure.
Researchers also witnessed a sizable number of tweets describing experiences where users reported being ''grabbed by the pussy.'' Kelly Oxford's call for disclosure through hashtag #NotOkay occurred only hours after Donald Trump admitted to ''grabbing [women] by the pussy.'' In the days that followed, Trump and others framed this admission as ''locker room talk''-condoning his behavior, normalizing the degradation of women in private conversations between men, and delegitimizing this act as a form of violence against women. It is therefore possible that survivors who were also ''grabbed by the pussy'' were triggered when Donald Trump's disclosure of engaging in this behavior was minimized by his supporters, and took to Twitter to reclaim the legitimacy of their experience and the harm associated with it. Specifically, experiences of physical violence and violation that targeted (cisgender) women's genitalia may have appeared more saliently as a result of Donald Trump's own admission.
It was notable that a sizable number of tweets in the sample did not reflect a disclosure of sexual victimization, and were excluded from analysis. Twitter was a popular forum for engaging in political dialogue during the 2016 election, and the volume of politically affiliated tweets that were excluded from this study-which exceeded the number of personal disclosures in this sample-suggest that #NotOkay functioned as a forum not only for personal disclosure but also as a forum for discussing broader issues relating to sexual violence. Therefore, it is possible that some survivors were negatively impacted by the use of #NotOkay to discuss topics outside of sexual assault (i.e., to endorse a specific candidate for office, or to comment on rape culture in general). Existing literature on sexual assault disclosure and response indicates that responses that draw attention away from the survivor's experience are seen as distracting-they do not prioritize the needs of the survivor, and instead give the impression that the support provider would rather focus on something else (Ullman 2010). It is therefore feasible that the cooptation of #NotOkay for political discourse may therefore have communicated to survivors that the climate of the forum was not hospitable to survivors, despite the intended purpose of #NotOkay as an avenue for disclosure of trauma.
This content analysis of tweets using the #NotOkay tag to characterize disclosures of sexual violence fills a significant gap in extant literature by not only examining a relatively large sample of prompted disclosures but also by outlining specifically what survivors choose to share when they are invited to disclose in a public forum. It is feasible that survivors were compelled by the 140-character limit on Twitter to only disclose the parts of their victimization experience more salient to them. However, an alternative potentiality must also be explored: it is possible that survivors instead shared the parts of their experiences that they believed would be considered particularly compelling to a social media community (i.e., Twitter). For example, it is possible that they assumed other Twitter users would respond more strongly to discussion of certain aspects of their experience, and were therefore more willing to share the ''shocking'' aspects of the trauma, rather than the parts of their victimization that have most strongly influenced their own day-to-day lives. As such, future research should examine whether survivors disclosed the aspects of their violence experiences that impacted them most severely, or aspects that they believed were most appropriate to disclose in this public forum.
It is also important to acknowledge the overall popularity of the #NotOkay tag, and the larger social implication that a hashtag such as this trended so widely. The widespread utilization of #NotOkay illustrates the pervasiveness of sexual violence. In addition, the popularity of commentary through #NotOkay illustrates suggests that survivors may be particularly likely to disclose their experiences to an online community, and the possibility that social media platforms are perceived as a particularly safe or meaningful platform for disclosure. While users who disclosed online may still have been subjected to harmful social reactions, such as distracting or egocentric responses, it is possible that this forum protected them from experiencing other potentially problematic reactions to disclosure, such as a respondent's facial expression, tone of voice, or body language (Ullman 2010). It is therefore possible that individuals who are especially sensitive to physical cues and reactions felt safer and more compelled to disclose victimization experiences online.
Limitations
Although analysis of Twitter data allows the opportunity to examine a range of public opinions, tweets are short and do not provide an opportunity for in-depth examination of an individual's experience, which is typically a hallmark of qualitative research. There are also limitations of using publicly available social media data (e.g., Giglietto et al. 2013). For example, it is unclear whether respondents in this study were frequent or infrequent users of Twitter, which limits the generalizability of these findings. Furthermore, although demographic information and geographic location of the users in this sample were collected by NCapture, this information was not included in the analysis. Inclusion of these characteristics could be seen as identifying information and infringe upon Twitter users' privacy, and to maintain currently accepted ethics of social media analysis, demographic information was excluded from data collection. As a result, comparisons of disclosures and public opinion could not be made as a function of the demographic characteristics or geographic location of users. To address this limitation, future research should examine how demographic characteristics such as race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation are associated with disclosure of sexual victimization online.
While researchers were able to code for type of victimization, with 73% of tweets providing explicit descriptions of the type of victimization, the 140-character limit of each disclosure precluded coding each tweet as representative of a specific type of violence (i.e., attempted assault vs. rape vs. unwanted sexual contact, etc.). This sample size also precluded examining whether survivors were particularly likely to disclose experiences perpetrated by specific types of perpetrators, such as a stranger versus an acquaintance or family member. Future analyses should therefore examine whether individuals are likely to disclose specific types of violence on social media platforms, while also keeping in mind that survivors use a wide range of labels to describe their experience (Orchowski et al. 2013b).
Recent examination of Twitter user demographics indicates that younger Americans are more likely than older Americans to use Twitter (36% of 18-29-year olds are active on Twitter, versus 10% of adults over the age of 65; Pew Research Center, 2016). Twitter is also slightly more popular among Americans with college degrees, compared with those who have received a high school diploma (Pew Research Center, 2016). Therefore, it is possible that this sample of tweets was drawn from younger, more educated Twitter users, and findings may not be generalized to the larger population. Furthermore, for consistency, data were collected at the same time on weekdays. It is feasible that individuals who tweet primarily after working hours, in the evening, or on weekends were not included in analyses. Similarly, using single time points on separate days meant that tweets from ongoing conversations between multiple users were not captured. It is also possible that researchers, despite best efforts to be aware of their personal biases, may have allowed their values to shape their interpretations of the data.
Research implications
This descriptive analysis establishes a basis for subsequent qualitative research, further examining experiences of individuals who utilized #NotOkay, and disclosure of violence victimization online. Collecting fine details about what survivors say when they disclose through survey or interview is challenging due to retrospective recall biases associated with researching prior events. Online forums and social media platforms may serve as ideal outlets to advance the literature in how survivors conceptualize their experiences when selfidentifying as a survivor. Moreover, future research should examine whether individuals feel more motivated to disclose, or experience greater catharsis, when sharing with an online community of self-identified survivors.
In future studies, it would be useful to employ a mixedmethods approach to understand why Twitter users utilized #NotOkay with such frequency, and understand the impact of disclosing victimization in this forum, at this time in history. It is possible that survivors might be particularly likely to disclose sensitive experiences in online forums that allow anonymity (see Suler 2004). Furthermore, it is possible that individuals who interacted with the #NotOkay tag experienced vicarious or secondary trauma as a result of participating in the emotionally charged forum. Future #NotOkay research should assess whether interacting with the tag resulted in social good (catharsis, feelings of support, the creation of an online support network, and improved knowledge of resources) or harm (mental health consequences and silencing) among survivors.
Clinical and policy implications
Although there is surprisingly little research on the disclosure of sexual victimization using online forums, some survivors turn to online disclosure because they feel it is their only option, cannot access available resources, or do not anticipate supportive responses from family and friends (Moors and Webber 2012). Online interventions may access those people who do not perceive their social networks to be supportive or who feel isolated. Twitter is being explored as a medium for the delivery of public health intervention (Prasetyo et al. 2015;Shepherd et al. 2015). Although most public health agencies use Twitter to broadcast information, rather than engage in dialogue (Lovejoy et al. 2012), it would be suitable to explore how agencies can use social media to support survivors and change problematic norms. Geographical Information Systems mapping can be utilized to ascertain the density of health problems reported by Twitter users (Bartlett and Wurtz 2015), and deliver targeted doses of interventions to those located in areas with the highest risk.

The present study sought to characterize use of the hashtag #UsToo on Twitter to disclose or comment on men's experiences of sexual victimization. A sample of 281 original content, English-language tweets containing the hashtag were collected from Twitter over five consecutive weekdays. Thematic content analysis was conducted by a three-person coding team (full team consensus, achieving 100% agreement). Researchers categorized tweets as either a disclosure of victimization (N = 6) or a response to this hashtag (N = 275). When responding to the hashtag, users commented on the emotional impact of victimization, provided positive responses within the forum (i.e., advocacy, call to action, raising awareness, and prosocial reactions), and also engaged in negative responses within the forum (i.e., distracting attention away from the experiences of victims, egocentric responses which called attention to themselves or others, and otherwise harmful reactions). Despite the popularity of the #MeToo hashtag to disclose personal experiences of violence victimization, Twitter users were

blame on the perpetrator; Ullman & Najdowski, 2011). Disclosure can also help victims to conceptualize the experience (Starzynski et al., 2005) and experience personal growth (Sorsoli et al., 2008).
When boys and men do tell someone about experiences of sexual victimization, data indicate that-like girls and women-disclosure often occurs long after the assault (Goodman-Brown et al., 2003). One analysis of the disclosure and reporting experiences of 487 men who were sexually victimized during childhood found that, on average, men who experience childhood sexual abuse first disclosed at about 32 years old, waited 21 years to disclose, and waited 28 years before engaging in an in-depth discussion of their abuse experience (Easton, 2013). Whereas there are numerous reasons why a survivor may wait to talk about their experience, waiting to disclose sexual victimization is associated with greater PTSD symptoms (Ullman, 2007). Further, due to legal statues of limitations for sexual crimes, delayed disclosure may limit the ability of law enforcement to hold perpetrators accountable (Weiss & Alexander, 2013).
Ascription to traditional masculine ideals may serve as a barrier to disclosing and reporting sexual victimization among men. Easton (2014) found that higher conformity to 11 traditional masculine norms, including masculine control and risk-taking, was associated with fewer help-seeking behaviors among men who experience sexual violence. There are several potential explanations for the association between ascription to traditional heteronormative masculine ideals and help-seeking behavior among men. First, experiencing victimization is inconsistent with the traditional masculine norm of ""male invincibility"" (Stemple & Meyer, 2014). Men are often perceived as being more capable of coping with adversity than women (Scarce, 1997), and are expected to be ""in control"" over both their emotions and their environment (Courtenay, 2000). As a result, men who experience sexual victimization may not talk to others about the experience for fear of being perceived as weak. Second, the misperception that men welcome all sexual interaction (see Smith, 2011) may also reduce the likelihood that men acknowledge unwanted sexual experiences as victimization (Sorsoli et al., 2008). Acceptance of rape myths may also predict men's likelihood to acknowledge or report sexual victimization. For example, Walfield (20 1) identified several widely held rape myths regarding experiences of sexual victimization among men (i.e., men cannot be raped by women, men can enjoy sex even when it is forced, and healthy men are able to physically resist victimization).
Men may also refrain from disclosing sexual victimization due to fear that others will respond negatively to the information or due to concerns that disclosure will disrupt their relationships (Sorsoli et al., 2008). Whereas positive reactions such as providing emotional support, validation, belief, and tangible aid have a protective effect against negative health outcomes, negative reactions, like disbelief or victim blame, exacerbate symptoms of posttraumatic stress, self-blame, depression, and problem coping (Dworkin et al., 2019;Sigurvinsdottir & Ullman, 2015;Ullman, 2010;Ullman et al., 2008). Notably, men are less likely than women to receive positive reactions to disclosure (Ullman & Filipas, 2005), which may reduce the likelihood that they tell others about the experience.
Social Media and Disclosure of Sexual Victimization
Social media is emerging as a widely utilized platform for disclosing and discussing experiences of sexual victimization (Bogen et al., 2018a(Bogen et al., , 2018b(Bogen et al., , 2021)). Twitter is a social media platform that allows users to view, post, and respond to short, character-limited messages referred to as ""tweets"", which may include original text generated by users, or links to external content, such as articles, news stories, or webpages (Twitter, 2017). Twitter users can include a ""hashtag"" (the symbol ""#"" followed by term or phrase describing the content of tweet) in their tweets to associate them with certain topics and allow other users interested in those topics to easily search for them (Yang, 2016).
Whereas the hashtag #MeToo emerged in 2017 as an opportunity for individuals to disclose experiences of sexual victimization via Twitter, with over 1.5 million tweets in the first week alone (i.e., Modrek & Chakalov, 2019), this hashtag was established specifically as a forum for women to describe their personal experiences of victimization. As discussed by Gallagher et al. (2019), the messaging around #MeToo also discouraged disclosure by individuals who did not identify as a woman. It is therefore not surprising that Gallagher et al. found that 97.4% of tweets in a random sample of posts with the hashtag #MeToo were authored by women. Given that there has yet to be a movement comparable to #MeToo which prompts disclosure of sexual victimization among men, we currently have little information regarding how men discuss and disclose experiences of sexual violence online. For example, Fawcett and Shrestha's (2016) thematic analysis of the personal blogs of sexual assault survivors included only one blog written by a man.
The tendency to frame women as victims of sexual violence and men as perpetrators may therefore preclude some men from discussing their own experiences of sexual victimization in public and online spaces (Stemple et al., 2017). For example, efforts to raise awareness about sexual victimization also tend to focus on women who experience sexual victimization (Arnold, 2017). Further, efforts to engage men and boys in sexual violence prevention generally urge men to take responsibility as proactive bystanders when they witness other men engaging in sexually aggressive behavior (Denov, 2003;Funk, 2008;Stemple & Meyer, 2014).
There are several reasons to expect that men would participate in online forums established as platforms for discussion of sexual violence in a manner that differs from women. Men's internet usage tends to mirror the goals prescribed by masculinity norms during in-person interactions, that is, interactions often reflect competition and markers of social status (Haferkamp et al., 2012). In fact, examinations of social media profiles on the social networking site MySpace found that men's online portrayals of themselves conformed to and emphasized stereotypes of masculinity, including strength, power, and status (Manago et al., 2008;Sveningsson, 2007).
Despite the paucity of research examining men's disclosure of sexual victimization in online forums, it is feasible that online platforms may enable men to more readily discuss their own experiences of sexual victimization. As discussed by Suler (2004), individuals generally exhibit disinhibited behavior when interacting online. Feelings of online anonymity may reduce the sense of vulnerability that people typically experience when sharing personal information in person. When individuals post information online, they do not see or hear the other individuals who receive their information and may be more likely to continue their train of thought without interruption or self-censoring. Whereas these factors may promote disclosure of sensitive information via social media, online disinhibition also facilitates hostility, harsh criticism and threatening behavior in individuals who comment on posts in online forums (Alonzo & Aiken, 2004;Lapidot-Lefler & Barak, 2012, 2015), which can increase the likelihood that individuals experience a negative social reaction to disclosing sexual victimization (see Bogen et al., 2018a;Bogen et al., 2021).
Sexual Victimization Among Men and the Twitter Hashtag #UsToo
Efforts to raise awareness about sexual violence are more frequently occurring via social media. For example, the ""Me Too Movement"", which seeks to empower survivors of sexual violence to disclose their experience, was created nearly a decade earlier by black social justice activist Tarana Burke, and gained widespread attention and impact across social media platforms (Hawbacker, 2019). Twitter emerged as a particularly popular social media platform for disclosing personal experiences of sexual victimization using the hashtag #MeToo (Bogen et al., 2018b). Individuals who disclose their experience using the hashtag #MeToo report feeling empowered by the experience (Eiler et al., 2019). Notably, however, efforts to raise awareness of sexual violence via social media have largely focused on women's victimization experiences (Harlow et al., 2021;PettyJohn et al., 2019;Pipyrou, 2018).
On August 2, 2018, The New York Times released a story detailing experiences of sexual abuse among young men on the Ohio State wrestling team (Edmondson & Tracy, 2018). Over 100 men came forward to report that they experienced sexual molestation perpetrated by Dr Richard Strauss, a physician at Ohio State who had acted as team doctor from the 1970s to 1990s. Jim Jordan-a member of the United States Congress-served as the assistant wrestling coach at the time of the abuse and was accused of knowing that the athletes were experiencing sexual abuse, yet failing to report to the proper authorities. The New York Times article, entitled ""It Can Happen Even to Guys: Ohio State Wrestlers Detail Abuse, Saying #UsToo,"" sparked conversation on Twitter via the hashtag #UsToo. Given the common use of #MeToo by white, cisgender women, the hashtag #UsToo had been previously utilized by women of marginalized groups to discuss experiences of sexual violence (Onwuachi-Willig, 2018). Following the widespread news coverage of The New York Times article, this hashtag was largely employed to comment on the disclosure of sexual abuse among men at Ohio State, and discuss the experience of sexual victimization among men more broadly.
Given the paucity of research examining men's participation in social media platforms to discuss experiences of sexual victimization, the present research study sought to characterize how individuals utilized the hashtag #UsToo to disclose and respond to experiences of sexual victimization among men. Two research questions were posed. First, how did Twitter users utilize the hashtag #UsToo to disclose personal experiences of sexual victimization? Second, how did Twitter users utilize the hashtag #UsToo to either positively or negatively comment on experiences of sexual victimization among men? As these research questions were descriptive in nature, no specific hypotheses were proposed.
Method

Procedure
Tweets using the hashtag ""#UsToo"" were downloaded at approximately 11:30 am daily over five consecutive weekdays (August 3, 2018to August 9, 2018). Data collection began the day after the related The New York Times article was published, while the piece was widely discussed on social media. This timeline of data capture aligns with extant research on social media analysis as it allows researchers to collect data during the ""peak"" of online conversation regarding a focused topic (Bogen et al., 2021;McCauley et al., 2018). Data capture was achieved using NCapture, a NVivo toolbar addition created for Google Chrome that facilitates the collection of publicly accessible social media data. The present research did not involve human subject participation and examined only publicly accessible tweets; this project was deemed exempt from IRB review. The anonymity of those who produced the tweets included in the present study was further protected by removing usernames, locations, and Twitter user bios-which have the potential to be personally identifiable-from the dataset prior to coding. No demographic information is collected when using NCapture. However, a higher proportion of Twitter users are black, young, urban, and educated than the general US population (Smith & Anderson, 2018).
Data Preparation
In total, 12,111 tweets were collected from users with public Twitter profiles during the data collection window. Consistent with social media content analysis research (Bogen et al., 2018a(Bogen et al., , 2018b)), data were cleaned to isolate original content tweets. Tweets including the #UsToo hashtag alone or with a linked article and/or @user but no original content (n = 625), tweets in which a user simply reposted another user's tweet with no additional content (i.e., ""retweets""; n = 11,089), and irrelevant/non-English tweets (e.g., tags from competing #UsToo movements for STEM/black/indigenous women; n = 65) were removed from the dataset, resulting in final sample of 332 original tweets. This sample size is consistent with qualitative analyses of social media data (Bogen et al., 2021;Jaremko et al., 2019). NCapture collects the first 140 characters of data provided in a tweet. As Twitter has expanded the character limit that can be included in a tweet from 140 to 280 characters, researchers manually checked links associated with downloaded tweet content in order to code the full tweets. Most of the longer tweets (over 95%) were associated with working links, which allowed researchers to code the full text. However, it is expected that a small amount of information included in tweets longer than 140 characters was not included in the analysis.
Coding Procedure
The coding process enabled researchers to identify factors relating to disclosure of sexual victimization using hashtag #UsToo, as well as responses to disclosure of sexual victimization using hashtag #UsToo. The coding procedure used in the present work was guided by a preconstructed codebook applied to previous analysis of Twitter disclosures (Bogen et al., 2018a;Bogen et al., 2018b). One portion of the codebook included factors commonly included in online sexual assault disclosure (i.e., who, what, when, where, why, how). The next portion of the codebook included factors commonly included in reactions to disclosure of sexual victimization in an online forum. These factors included some social reactions to sexual assault disclosure documented in Ullman's (2000) classification systems of social reactions to in-person sexual assault disclosure, as well as social reactions documented in response to online sexual assault disclosure (e.g., advocacy, hashtag commentary; Bogen et al., 2018a).
Consistent with processes for developing thematic reliability and validity in qualitative research (Alhojailan, 2012), the primary and secondary coder built the initial a priori codebook and invited the consensus coder-a senior researcher in the field of violence prevention, victim disclosure, and social reactions-to assess the codebook for validity. The essential role of the consensus coder during codebook construction was to identify whether the primary and secondary coder had failed to include relevant themes and to provide feedback ensuring the codebook reflected extant research on patterns of disclosure and response. Importantly, in addition to the inclusion of these a priori themes, researchers followed open-ended coding procedures in order to allow themes and subthemes to emerge that fell outside of the preconstructed codebook.
A priori codes included the major theme to indicate whether each tweet represented a disclosure or a response. When a tweet was categorized as a response, it was next coded as either: (a) commentary on the hashtag; (b) a positive/supportive response; or (c) a negative/harmful response. Within positive reactions, tweets were coded as advocacy, call to action, emotional support, and raising awareness. Within negative reactions, tweets were coded as distracting, egocentric, or harmful. The decision to code tweets as either positive or negative responses was based on previous qualitative work examining social reactions to in-person disclosures, which utilized this classification scheme (Bogen et al., 2018b;Bogen, 2019;Ullman, 2000). For example, all egocentric responses were categorized as negative, given evidence that inperson egocentric responses are associated with poorer survivor health outcomes (Ullman, 2010). Similarly, as distracting survivors from their process of disclosure (for example, trying to get them to talk about something else) may be seen as a ""turning away"" reaction (Ullman, 2010), distracting responses, regardless of whether they appeared to be well intended, were categorized as negative.
The combined process of content-and codebook-guided analysis resulted in a final codebook containing three primary themes-disclosure, response, and hashtag commentary-as well as subthemes falling under each of these major themes. Themes that represented in more than 1% of the data (n = 3) were reported. Some themes were considered hierarchical, and therefore mutually exclusive. For example, tweets involving both disclosure and response were coded only as a disclosure. There were only a few tweets (n = 3) that qualified as both a disclosure and (positive or negative) response. Further, there were only a few instances in which the coding team experienced an initial disagreement on coding a tweet as either a positive or negative response. In some cases, a tweet reflected what could be considered both a positive and negative response. For example, one tweet noted, ""[Link] Continue to be true to who you are and f*** Jim Jordan. Call him out, he does not deserve to hold elected office."" Whereas this tweet encourages men who experience sexual violence to be true to themselves, it also shifts focus away from survivors' experience to Jim Jordan's role as an elected official. Whereas a third category was considered for tweets that included what could be categorized as both positive and negative responses, ultimately not enough tweets were identified that fit this classification. In these cases, the coding team decided upon the most salient classification of the tweet, with negative sentiment overriding the presence of positive sentiment.
The coding team consisted of three researchers in the field of sexual violence prevention. Each coding team member was familiar with existing characteristics of survivor disclosure, including knowledge of the literature regarding social reactions to disclosures. A senior researcher with expertise in sexual assault prevention and survivor support served as the consensus coder. Coders met once weekly for approximately four weeks. Coding disagreements were discussed in-person between team members until consensus was reached, resulting in 100% agreement on all thematic coding decisions.
Results

Disclosures of Sexual Violence Victimization Using #MeToo
A small sample of tweets (2%) reflected a personal disclosure of sexual victimization (N = 6). Most men who disclosed personal experiences of sexual victimization described experiences of childhood sexual abuse. For example, one Twitter user commented: I can echo the same terrible truth. #UsToo It happened to me when I was 6-10 years old. It has caught up with me and consumed me. I'm in therapy now but death was my only escape and it almost won. Please reach out. The stigma gets easier with time. Scary as hell though. Thank you.
Users commented on the emotional consequences of experiencing sexual victimization. For example, ""#MeToo needs to embrace #UsToo, because there are plenty of men who are abused and molested growing up. We just keep it bottled up and never talk about it. #UsToo"". As highlighted by the tweet, there was a question of whether MeToo was a movement that acknowledged men's experiences of victimization. Three users who disclosed via the hashtag also shared support for others using the hashtag, including one who wrote: ""For all who are afraid to tweet about it like I wasâ€¦ #MeToo #UsToo.""
Reactions to Sexual Violence Using #MeToo
Positive responses. Positive responses accounted for 69% of tweets (see Table 1), and were categorized into the subthemes of raising awareness, advocacy, prosocial responses, and calls to action, which are described in detail below.
Advocacy. Tweets coded as advocacy (27%) included those in which users spoke out on behalf of survivors, denounced the actions of individuals involved in the Ohio State scandal, or confronted inappropriate online behaviors by other members of the online community. In one advocacy tweet, a user wrote: ""Keep educating yourself about these problems, do not be ignorant, and be supportive of all who come forth during #MeTooMovement"", encouraging support for survivors. In another tweet demonstrating advocacy, an individual challenged the critical views of survivors expressed by other individuals in the online community; ""*Rant* Read reports on how male wrestlers were abused @ Michigan University #UsToo but disturbed most by the criticism 'how could well-built young men not fight back or why they didn't just punch the doctors/coaches,' it doesn't work that way.""
Call to action. Tweets coded as call to action (3%) represented messages that made efforts to activate others to become engaged in sexual violence prevention or offer positive reactions to disclosure of sexual victimization. These messages communicated a sense of group responsibility for ending sexual violence. For example, one individual directed those reading their tweet to ""Read this & educate yourself how even strong men can be victimsâ€¦ ."" Another user employed the word ""we"" to highlight the need for everyone to contribute to a cultural shift to prevent sexual violence, stating: ""Everyone deserves to be free of #HumanRights view need to work together to transform #ToxicCulture #Risk2Value & it starts at the #Board level & requires a strong & transparent #SpeakUp #ListenUp organizational culture."" Emotional support. Tweets coded as emotional support (11%) included those in which individuals expressed emotional support for survivors in the form of validation or belief, or by suggesting resources through which survivors could access tangible aid. For example, one Twitter user expressed emotional support for survivors by tweeting ""@nytimes I called them out a few weeks ago. I agree completely Mr. Nutter. You are a with us, with me. I am so sorry for what happened to you. It is a darkness that you do not have to go through alone anymore."" Another provided validation by tweeting ""I believe the 100 men #UsToo Someone make this right -give those guys the respect & support they deserve; the coaches didn't respect them & protect themwho will make this right?"" Tweets providing tangible aid typically included links to mental health and legal resources.
Raising awareness. Tweets coded as raising awareness comprised the largest portion of positive responses (36%) and included those in which users shared links and/or online articles providing information on the allegations of sexual misconduct at Ohio State that sparked the #UsToo movement, or men who experience sexual victimization in general. For instance, many responses in this category noted the prevalence of sexual victimization among men. One Twitter user commented: Negative responses. Negative responses accounted for 27 % of tweets (see Table 1), and were further categorized into the subthemes of distracting, egocentric, and harmful, which are described in detail further.
Distracting responses. Tweets coded as distracting (16%) shifted attention away from survivors' disclosures and towards related topics without reference to supporting survivors. Most often, tweets called for punitive actions to be taken against parties perceived as culpable, including politicians. For example, most distracting tweets called for retribution against Jim Jordan, a US senator who served as the assistant wrestling coach while the sexual misconduct occurred at Ohio State. A significant portion of distracting tweets also criticized political parties, politicians, public figures, or other organizations perceived to be in a position of power or responsibility to influence legal or social consequences for sexual violence, including tweets such as, ""After reading this post from @User I have to wonder in 2042 if the excuse will be, 'well those were the trump years.' As if #MeToo #UsToo isn't happening. Is @Lawrence O'Donnell the only one who will hold Rep Jordan accountable b/c Congress isn't."" In some cases, distracting tweets referenced parties not directly related to the events that initiated the hashtag #UsToo.
Egocentric responses. Tweets coded as egocentric (5%) focused on respondents' personal reactions, opinions, or role in sexual violence prevention efforts rather than survivor's experiences or needs. For example, one Twitter user emphasized their own fears about their children in the following tweet: ""Devastating. As I prepare to send my boys to college, I hope I've taught them enough [link]."" Individuals also demonstrated egocentric responses focused on self-promotion of their own engagement in activism against sexual violence; ""I'm at #NN18 hearing from activists from across the country including my brilliant colleagueâ€¦Join us at Friday at 9 am for the ""#UsToo overcoming invisibility & battling #MeToo backlash"" in room 220/ then Friday at 1 pm for the consent caucus in room 226!"" Other harmful responses. A final subtheme within negative responses captured tweets comprising a range of responses determined to be potentially harmful to survivors (Ullman, 2010). These included victim blame, disbelief, misogynistic sentiment, or trolling behavior. Trolling behavior is defined as posting inflammatory or off-topic material within an online community for the purpose of upsetting others or starting conflict (see Paavola et al., 2016). For instance, one Twitter user expressed their disbelief of the reports of sexual misconduct made by Ohio State wrestlers by commenting ""WHATS INAPPROPRIATE IF YOU'RE A WRESTLER?"", suggesting that no form of physical contact is inappropriate in the context of wrestling. Trolling behavior documented within tweets included the following: ""@User Gonna be taking the dick by force! #UsToo"". The tweet from this individual, who suggests that a specific Twitter user would be sexually assaulted, is representative of some of the threatening and vitriolic dialogue that occurred within the thread that not only diminished the seriousness of sexual violence, but also contributed to the normalization of its occurrence.
Commentary on the Hashtag
A small sample of tweets (2%) utilized the hashtag #UsToo to comment on the hashtag itself (N = 7). Some tweets expressed personal support for the forum. For example, one Twitter user commented: ""I love this so much. #MeToo #UsToo (for the men victims of sexual abuse)"". Other tweets raised concern regarding the emergence of #UsToo as a separate space for men to disclose personal experiences of sexual victimization, suggesting instead that men should disclose personal experiences of trauma using #MeToo. For example, one Twitter user commented: ""Please read this. It's important to know that boys/men can be abused too. Wrestlers even. I just object to the use of #UsToo. Why separate it from #MeToo?"".
Discussion
The present study sought to examine Twitter dialogue regarding sexual violence victimization among men using the hashtag #UsToo. Recent research examining the use of hashtags such as #MeToo has provided insight into the ways in which social media may be used to elicit and provide support for women who experience sexual violence. Results of the current study revealed both discrepancies and similarities in patterns of online communication regarding sexual violence victimization among men using the Twitter hashtag #UsToo, detailed further.
Disclosures of Sexual Violence Victimization
The first aim of the present study was to examine the use of #UsToo by men to disclose and characterize their experiences of sexual violence victimization. Given that #MeToo emerged as a popular venue for women's disclosure of sexual victimization, it would have been reasonable to expect that #UsToo would likewise be heavily utilized as a forum for men to disclose their personal experiences of sexual violence. However, personal disclosures of sexual victimization comprised only 2% (N = 6) of the sample of tweets analyzed in the current study. It appears that, rather than being utilized as a platform for disclosures or to provide support for men who experience sexual violence, the hashtag #UsToo was utilized to discuss the sexual abuse of young men on the Ohio State wrestling team. The widespread use of #UsToo to share commentary about the Times piece may have discouraged men who experience sexual violence from coming forward via the hashtag, in spite of the stated goal that #UsToo provided a space for men victims to discuss their experiences. Variation in online disclosure rates between men and women is consistent with previous research, demonstrating different rates of in-person sexual assault disclosure among men and women (see Cohen, 2014). As is true for women who experience sexual assault, some men never report their victimization (Javaid, 2016). Weiss (2010) suggests that men who do disclose experiences of sexual violence are more likely to disclose victimization perpetrated by a man than by a woman. Further, men who disclosed also shared support and encouragement for others using the hashtag, indicating that individuals who disclose victimization online may also react in supportive ways that foster group solidarity. Ascription to traditional masculine norms which prioritize toughness may contribute to low rates of sexual violence disclosure among men (Copelon, 1994;Kassing et al., 2005;Mendel, 1995). There is significant evidence to suggest that normative beliefs regarding masculinity, such as the expectation that men be strong in control of their emotions (King, 1992), undermine men's ability to safely and comfortably disclose sexual victimization. These stigmatizing views may inhibit men from seeking support and accessing activist communities that may validate their experiences (Allen et al., 2015). Future research is needed to explore whether individuals who experience sexual violence remain inhibited from disclosing experiences online due to fear of negative reactions, such as victim blame. Men who experience sexual violence may also hold internalized rape myths, including the belief that men cannot be raped by women, and that men can enjoy forced sex (Walfield, 2021). Men may hesitate to disclose if they themselves adhere to these myths or are concerned that these beliefs are held by members of their own social networks.
Of note, research on online disclosure of sexual victimization suggests that individuals who disclose online report higher levels of trauma-related distress, lower self-esteem in the aftermath of sexual trauma, and a desire for improved self-image following an experience of sexual victimization (Fawcett & Shrestha, 2016;Moors & Webber, 2013). Individuals may also lack of adequate emotional support in their in-person social networks (Andalibi et al., 2016). As these findings were gleaned from samples comprised predominantly of women, future research is needed to better understand the characteristics of individuals who disclose experiences of sexual violence online.
Reactions to Sexual Victimization Among Men
The second aim of the present study was to characterize reactions of Twitter users to men's experiences of sexual victimization. The patterns of responses documented in previous analyses of Twitter dialogue using #MeToo (Bogen et al., 2021) also emerged in the present dataset. Specifically, most tweets (69%) were positive in valence, raising awareness of sexual violence and advocating for victims. A smaller portion of tweets classified as positive responses expressed emotional support (11.5%), and only a few involved taking responsibility for addressing the issue of sexual violence among men. The prevalence of these themes in Twitter user's reactions underscore the unique and positive contributions of social media discourse in increasing sexual violence prevention and intervention efforts. However, the extent to which such positive reactions were associated with positive outcomes cannot be determined in the current analyses. Prospective research which engages Twitter users in assessments of health outcomes over time is needed to better understand the association between online disclosure of sexual victimization, positive social reactions, and health outcomes.
Like the rates of negative responses documented in analyses of the hashtag #MeToo (Bogen et al., 2021), negative responses using #UsToo comprised nearly one-third of the sample (27%) and consisted mostly of tweets that were categorized as distracting (16%). An interesting and somewhat unique quality of distracting twee",6464,7458
10.1177/2056305120974610,,Deal et al 2020,True,Bonnie-Elene Deal,â€œI Definitely Did Not Report It When I Was Raped . . . #WeBelieveChristine #MeTooâ€: A Content Analysis of Disclosures of Sexual Assault on Twitter,"
The ""Me Too"" movement, founded by activist Tarana Burke, began in 2006, before Twitter became the viral platform for political activism and news media that it is known for today. The reemergence of the Me Too movement on Twitter in 2017 sparked a widespread focus on the societal issue of sexual misconduct. This study examines sexual assault disclosures as an aspect of such misconduct through the context of the Me Too movement on Twitter. Through the use of content analysis, online disclosures of sexual assault (N = 1,459) are examined for variations of sexual explicitness and attainment of social functions per the functional theory of self-disclosure. Specifically, this study explores associations between Twitter network structure and (1) levels of sexual explicitness and (2) retweet count. Through manual coding and statistical analysis, the study finds associations between sexual explicitness of online disclosures and retweet count as well as associations between network structure and sexual explicitness of disclosures. The study shifts the focus of disclosure discourse from dyadic communication to the contemporary context of networked social media. Implications for theory and practice are discussed, which include, but are not limited to, the exploration of associations between disclosing and catharsis, disclosing that may be characterized as neutral or conflicted, and disclosing sexual assault without being sexually explicit.

The ""Me Too"" movement was founded in 2006 by social activist Tarana Burke (Xiong et al., 2019), who sought to bring awareness to the issue of sexual assault experienced by women of color (Burke, 2017). For over a decade, Burke has been tirelessly advocating, writing, and speaking to bring attention to the broader issue of sexual assault and, more specifically, the issues of sexual violence and sexual harassment against girls and women of color. Over a decade after Burke founded the Me Too movement, it was popularized in social media by a post from Alyssa Milano in 2017 (Kearl, 2018) after news broke of the sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein in October 2017. Those events marked an inflection point in the prevalence of sexual harassment, sexual assault, and sexual victimization topics in social media and contributed significantly to the widespread #MeToo movement (Starkey et al., 2019). Intending to shed light on how frequently behaviors of sexual misconduct occur, the Me Too movement includes disclosure narratives by survivors as well as responses to survivor disclosures (Tolentino, 2018). The #MeToo hashtag invites survivors to share their experiences, but beyond digital platforms, the movement itself encompasses more: It advocates for awareness of the prevalence of sexual misconduct throughout society and the (detrimental) impacts such experiences may have on survivors, their social networks, and organizations. Furthermore, the reemergence of Me Too and its uprising on Twitter led to the development of other movements dedicated to raising awareness of sexual misconduct, including Time's Up and #YESALLWOMEN. As a result, the #MeToo movement has begun to receive attention from scholars (e.g., Battaglia et al., 2019). With the uprising of #MeToo came a surge of interdisciplinary research on sexual assault, disclosures, and the Me Too movement (Bogen, Millman, et al., 2018;Bogen et al., 2019;Chowdhury et al., 2019;Evans, 2018). To date, however, such research has not included studies that focus specifically on the behavior of disclosing from a perspective of analyzing big data trends.
Although self-disclosure, in general, and disclosure of traumatizing experiences, in particular, have been examined from a number of theoretical perspectives, few of these approaches have been applied to online fora or modalities. Studies that examined self-disclosure in online media generally have examined relatively routine forms of disclosure (e.g., Desjarlais et al., 2015;Dworkin et al., 2016;Hollenbaugh & Ferris, 2015;Utz, 2015;Varnali & Toker, 2015;Xie & Kang, 2015). Research examining sexual assault disclosures have typically focused on the process in face-toface or recalled forms (e.g., Bicanic et al., 2015;Campbell et al., 2015;Lorenz et al., 2018). Others have focused on the motives (e.g., Hollenbaugh & Ferris, 2014) or social reactions and effects (e.g., Jackson et al., 2017;Kirkner et al., 2018;Paul et al., 2014) to such online disclosures of sexual assault.
The generalizability of traditional theories of self-disclosure to online media remains an open question. For example, previous research has explored the application of the functional theory of self-disclosure to Facebook (Bazarova & Choi, 2014). Specifically, Bazarova and Choi (2014) investigated disclosure from a functional perspective in public and private Facebook posts (Bazarova & Choi, 2014;Choi & Bazarova, 2015). While some of the processes and functions of sexual assault narratives (Bletzer & Koss, 2004;Cairns, 1994;Muldoon et al., 2016) and disclosures (Nguyen et al., 2012) in online media are likely to traverse offline and online modalities, research indicates that digital fora have resulted in a digital narrative form with unique vernacular. ""These new digitized narratives not only shape what is disclosed and known about sexual violence, but what is felt and experienced"" (Mendes et al., 2019(Mendes et al., , p. 1304)). The aim of this research has been to apply the functionality of self-disclosure to the specific context of sexual assault-related content on the social networking site (SNS) Twitter, specifically through a content analysis of disclosure tweets.
The current study analyzes the #MeToo movement on Twitter because of the relevance of the platform to the movement. The concept of ""me too"" as it relates to sexual misconduct dates back to 2006 on Myspace (Rodino-Colocino, 2018), but its virality on Twitter as of October 2017 has elicited and evoked extensive attention on the platform, thereby propelling the movement into mainstream media. As of its 1-year anniversary, #MeToo had been used approximately 19 million times (Pew Research Center, 2018). Currently, 38% of young adults (ages 18-29 years) are active on Twitter (Aslam, 2020), indicating that the platform's relevance amid a society driven by social media is worth examining. Many communicative behaviors are enacted online, which is why it is imperative that behavior on social media platforms, particularly as it relates to societal problems such as sexual misconduct, should be integrated into theoretical frameworks and future communication research.
Self-disclosure broadly ""includes any information exchange that refers to the self, including personal states, dispositions, events in the past, and plans for the future"" (Derlega & Grzelak, 1979, p. 152). Original functional conceptions of self-disclosure included the parameters of breadth and depth (Altman & Taylor, 1973;Cozby, 1973), and other scholars have noted the multidimensionality of the concept, which includes the components of honesty, intent, and the positive or negative valence of the information to the discloser (Wheeless & Grotz, 1976). Whereas the functions of sexual assault disclosure have been studied in face-to-face contexts, there is a need to investigate the process in online contexts such as Twitter. To conceptualize disclosure in this modality, it is important to examine what is currently known about the process of sexual assault disclosures in general.
Disclosures of Sexual Assault
A prevalent theme among disclosure discourse as it relates to sexual assault is the role of social support as a communicative tactic (Bogen, Leach, et al., 2018;DeLoveh & Cattaneo, 2017;Demers et al., 2017). In particular, observed social support has been linked with recipient reactions (e.g., Ullman, 1996). Advancements in technology have made it possible to expand upon studies such as Ullman's (1996), with the ability to communicate digitally with significantly larger audiences (Fawcett & Shrestha, 2016). With social media serving as modes of communication for 88% of adults (Smith & Anderson, 2018), their role in the discourse of sexual assault disclosures must not be neglected.
Research on sexual assault disclosures has been continued through further examinations of social support sought by victims (Ullman, 1999) as well as demographic and assault factors related to social support (Ullman & Filipas, 2001). Even when research on disclosures incorporated factors of perceived control and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (Ullman & Peter-Hagene, 2014), the scope of disclosure discourse relating to sexual assault did not extend beyond interpersonal communication research. If anything, the continued examinations of sexual assault disclosures shifted focus to the reactions of disclosure recipients (Branch & Richards, 2013;Orchowski & Gidycz, 2012) and the communication challenges faced by being a confidant for a disclosing survivor (Middleton et al., 2016;Milliken et al., 2016). As such, the role of social media in the social construction of sexual assault victimization and support has yet to be seriously investigated.
#MeToo and the Topic of Sexual Misconduct on Social Media
The #MeToo movement has emerged as a topic of interest in the media and in fields such as medicine (Jagsi, 2018) and women's studies (Mendes et al., 2018); however, its presence within communication research has not yet received equal observation. A few qualitative analyses have examined rape culture themes (Stubbs-Richardson et al., 2018), themes of online disclosures of sexual assault (Bogen et al., 2018), and the online social reactions to sexual assault disclosures on Twitter (Bogen et al., 2019). Considering the limitations of the chosen method for the previous studies, quantitative research focusing on sexual assault disclosures limits personal biases from warping interpretations of data, which have been acknowledged as problematic (Bogen et al., 2018). Furthermore, Twitter users may have shared exaggerated, untruthful, or mocking disclosures upon being prompted by a public figure to use a specific hashtag in participating in a movement (Bogen et al., 2018). The disclosure tweets that comprised the data may not have been genuine but rather were possibly shared by Twitter users who provided information out of a desire to belong. This study is uniquely positioned to examine online disclosures of sexual assault without the potential for prompts or biases to hinder the data and subsequent analyses.
#MeToo operates as a clickable feature on Twitter and, since its uprising 2017, has transformed into a widespread social media movement. Its potential functionality, however, extends beyond Twitter. Its association with narratives of disclosures of rape and sexual assault has opened opportunities for people to disclose their experiences, even if they do not tweet using the hashtag or the phrase without the ""#."" For the purposes of this study, #MeToo has served as a starting point for how disclosures on Twitter by survivors of sexual assault will be content analyzed while also including associated relevant hashtags such as #WhyIDidntReport and #IBelieveHer.
Theoretical Underpinnings: The Functional Theory of Self-Disclosure
To pursue an extension of the discourse of sexual misconduct disclosures, this study utilizes the functional theory of selfdisclosure (Derlega & Grzelak, 1979;Prager et al., 1989;L. B. Rosenfeld & Kendrick, 1984). The theory asserts that there are five classes of functionality of a self-disclosure. These classes include (1) expression, (2) self-clarification, (3) social validation, (4) relationship development, and (5) social control. Expression is defined as the cathartic function of a self-disclosure. An opportunity to disclose provides an individual with a way to release feelings or emotions that have been repressed (Derlega & Grzelak, 1979). Selfclarification serves a cognitive function of a self-disclosure. When individuals self-clarify during a disclosure, they are clarifying their own opinions or issues regarding the issue at the center of the disclosure (Derlega & Grzelak, 1979). Social validation involves seeking feedback from an audience, which ultimately can validate the discloser's self-concept (Derlega & Grzelak, 1979). Relationship development is defined as a reward function of a self-disclosure in which the disclosure facilitates the development and maintenance of a relationship with the message receiver(s) because of the perceived rewarding nature of information exchange (Derlega & Grzelak, 1979). Last, the function of self-control in a self-disclosure is oriented to the personal information of the discloser. Through selectivity of personal details and target of disclosure, self-disclosure functions to maintain control of the communication and the social relationship (Derlega & Grzelak, 1979;L. B. Rosenfeld, 1979).
Until recently, the five functions of disclosure have been conceptualized as social affordances in the interpersonal context; however, more research on applications of disclosure functions and social media is needed (e.g., Karahanna et al., 2018;Rathnayake & Winter, 2018). In a similar way to how Bazarova and Choi (2014) applied functionality of selfdisclosure to Facebook statuses, this study seeks to incorporate components of the theory to the online setting, specifically Twitter, thus prompting the first research question:
RQ 1 : What are the most common types of social affordances sought in disclosing experiences of sexual assault on Twitter?
Much of the research on disclosures, including disclosures of sexual assault, has focused on the human subjects who enact the communication (Ahrens & Aldana, 2012;Ahrens et al., 2010). In this way, other modes of messagesending and receiving, such as interaction in social media, have been neglected. Granted, there have been examinations of disclosures on social media platforms (e.g., Clark-Gordon et al., 2019;Leighton et al., 2018;Nguyen et al., 2012;Ruppel et al., 2017). For example, disclosures of depression on Instagram (Andalibi et al., 2017) have received scholarly attention, as have the relationships between disclosure and intimacy among social media platforms (Bazarova, 2012;Jiang et al., 2011;Ma et al., 2016). It is not at all clear, however, that such research generalizes to disclosures of sexual assault or the #MeToo movement on Twitter, given the potential political, organizational, and interpersonal and social support motives that may be involved.
Breadth, Depth, and Explicitness as They Relate to Theoretical Underpinnings
Revelations of personal information may vary at least in their degrees of explicitness as well as breadth and depth (Altman & Taylor, 1973;Cozby, 1973;Derlega & Grzelak, 1979;Wheeless & Grotz, 1976). While some individuals may disclose personal information at high degrees of breadth, depth, and explicitness, such as the status of their mental health or their sexual orientation (Bazarova & Choi, 2014), others may only be willing to reveal general information, such as how they are feeling at a particular moment (Derlega & Grzelak, 1979).
People also use social media as means by which they record self-disclosures (Bazarova, 2012;Bazarova & Choi, 2014;Choi & Bazarova, 2015;Jiang et al., 2011). Twitter is one of the most frequented and actively used social media platforms (Smith & Anderson, 2018), but not every user engages with the same networks. While sexual explicitness has received attention from researchers (Bleakley et al., 2012;Leone, 2002), there appears to be no research specifically on sexual assault disclosure explicitness. Lin et al. (2014) found that individuals with larger networks on Facebook have a stronger need for impression management with regard to the content they post. For this study, impression management may be an influential factor in the relationship between Twitter network size and the level of explicitness of a disclosure. The details of a sexual assault that are part of explicit disclosures may be included as a strategy for impression management; for instance, such disclosures may be designed in an effort to avoid victim blaming and victim shaming. Because sexual assault has garnered rapid widespread attention in the last year, people may want to be involved with the conversation, but in such a way that does not reflect poorly on them, particularly because the topic is so public. In addition, Xie and Kang (2015) found that SNS users disclose more information when their network sizes are larger. They also found that when users' networks are comprised of strangers or people they have never met in person, their willingness to self-disclose online increases. While neither study focuses on Twitter network size and the association with explicitness of a disclosure, their findings are suggestive that network size may play a role in how people self-disclose online. As such, H 1 : The size of a user's network will be positively associated with the level of sexual explicitness of their online disclosure.
From its start in March 2006, Twitter content was limited to 140 characters, which included spaces and punctuation marks. November 7, 2017, marked the platform's official update from 140 characters per tweet to 280 characters per tweet (Tsukayama, 2017). This update, although still limiting how much content any user may include per individual post, has had effects on the amount and type of content that comprise tweets (Gligoric et al., 2018). Twitter also offers the retweet feature, which allows users to repeat someone else's content to their own profile and public feed without having to retype it. Tweets that are made up of relatable sentiments, keywords, and expressions of interest receive more retweets than tweets that do not include these features (Vougioukas et al., 2017). Furthermore, as evidenced by Tsugawa and Ohsaki (2015), negativity bias is highly influential in social media because it asserts that negative things have a stronger impact on people than do positive things (Baumeister & Bratslavsky, 2001;Rozin & Royzman, 2001;Taylor, 1991). This would explain why negative messages spread more rapidly on social media, as well as Tsugawa and Ohsaki's (2015) finding that negative tweets receive larger volumes of retweets than do neutral and positive tweets. Given that victims of sexual assault are likely to speak of their experiences in negative terms (Holland & Cortina, 2017;Katz et al., 2017;Starzynski et al., 2017), sexual explicitness in tweet content of online disclosures is expected to be associated with the number of times a post is retweeted: H 2 : Level of explicitness of an online disclosure will be positively associated with the number of times it is retweeted.
Finally, while Twitter limits its users in terms of how many characters they may use per tweet, it does not censor the content that comprises each tweet. Twitter users are free to include anyone's name in their tweets and tag specific users with the use of ""@"" before a user's handle. With Twitter's lack of prohibition regarding explicitness of content and inclusion of people's names, the final research question is posed: RQ 2 : Do online disclosures that reveal the perpetrator's identity receive more retweets?
Method

Sample
Data from Twitter users (tweets) living in eight major U.S. cities were analyzed for the purposes of this study (Boston, Chicago, El Paso, Los Angeles [LA], Miami, New York [NY], Philadelphia, and Phoenix). These cities were selected for analysis following research of the violent crime rates of the United States. Each of these eight cities holds high recorded numbers of reported rapes to law enforcement (Federal Bureau of Investigation: Uniform Crime Reporting [FBI: UCR], 2016a, 2016b, 2016c, 2016d, 2016e, 2016f, 2016g, 2016h). Regarding violent crime reporting, rape is the most underreported crime in the United States. An estimated 63% of sexual assaults are not reported to law enforcement (Rennison, 2002); as such, it is critical to consider that the reported numbers of rape by the FBI: UCR reports are lower than the actual number of rapes and sexual assaults that occur in each city.
Data Collection
A collection of tweets about disclosures of sexual assault was obtained through the use of the Social Media Analytic and Research Testbed (SMART) dashboard (Tsou et al., 2015;Yang et al., 2016). Through an integration of a social media application program interface (API), keywords and phrases within the data were observed. The topic of disclosures of sexual assault were defined by specific key terms. These key terms were entered into the SMART dashboard; then, a Twitter search API collected and filtered data on a daily basis. This method only collected new data as they came through the API filter; no disclosures on Twitter prior to August 2018 were collected as part of this study. Once collected, data were stored and accessible on a dashboard through the MongoDB database (Tsou et al., 2017), which displayed visuals of the collected data.
The key terms for this study were determined through combinations of specific words that relate to the general theme of sexual misconduct and to the more specific themes of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment. Several key terms contain hashtagged (the use of ""#"" in front of a word or phrase in a tweet, turning the word or phrase into a link that directs users to all other associated tweets) words or phrases. The hashtags represent the trending Me Too movement that has maintained public attention since its uprising on Twitter in 2017. These terms comprise part of the list because of the movement's direct relevance to the broad theme of sexual misconduct. The key terms that were entered into the SMART dashboard were the following: I was raped, I was raped + consent, I was raped + #metoo, I was raped + me too, I was sexually abused + #metoo, I was sexually abused + me too, I was sexually harassed + #metoo, I was sexually harassed + me too, I said no + consent + sex, and I survived + rape. The list of key terms entered into the SMART dashboard for this study is not indicative of all terms associated with themes of sexual misconduct. Certain words, including victim and survivor, as well as other combinations of these terms, were not included on the list entered into the SMART dashboard due to their binary nature. These terms were still gathered as part of the data collection if they were combined with any of the words or phrases on the determined list.
A total of 41,671 tweets were collected and stored between August and November 2018. A total of 40,087 nonunique tweets (retweets) comprised the total collection. A random sample of 1,458 tweets from unique users in seven of the eight cities was drawn using a random number generator. The Twitter API collected no tweets from El Paso; therefore, the city did not contribute to the study. Tweets from LA and NY contributed most of the data (LA = 25.6%; NY = 39.3%). The sample comprised original tweets (71.1%) and retweets (28.9%), with each retweet only appearing once in the data set to avoid redundancies in repeated content.
Coding Procedure
To obtain the data for this content analysis, a codebook was developed based on the model provided by Martinez et al. (2018). Table 1 provides the full codebook used for this content analysis. Given no prior category systems for online sexual assault disclosure, code definitions and categories were developed using Altman and Taylor's (1973) and Cozby's (1973) self-disclosure parameters of breadth and depth as well as the social affordances components of Derlega and Grzelak's (1979) functional theory of self-disclosure. Features of the Twitter platform also contributed to the development of code definitions and categories.
Tweets were coded for social affordances only if they were determined to be self-disclosures. To determine whether a tweet was a self-disclosure of an experience of sexual assault, each entry was coded for the parameters of breadth and depth. Breadth refers to the amount of information disclosed while depth refers to the intimacy of the information disclosed (Altman & Taylor, 1973;Cozby, 1973). For the purposes of this study, breadth was determined by the definition, ""The Twitter disclosure is not solely focused on the disclosure of the sexual assault,"" and was coded as 0 = no or 1 = yes. Depth was determined based on whether the information that comprised the Twitter disclosure was personal information of the user, and was coded as 0 = no or 1 = yes. In order for a tweet to be considered a self-disclosure, it had to be coded as breadth = 0, depth = 1. This specific coding is mandated by the definition of self-disclosure, which claims that ""self-disclosure includes any information exchange that refers to the self, including personal states, dispositions, events in the past, and plans for the future"" (Derlega & Grzelak, 1979, p. 152). This combination of coding ensured that the content of the tweet focused specifically on the topic of sexual assault (breadth) and represented personal information being revealed by the discloser (depth), thus constituting a self-disclosure.
Upon being coded as a self-disclosure (0 = no, 1 = yes), each tweet was then coded for sexual explicitness. The social affordances of functional self-disclosure presented by Derlega and Grzelak (1979) were then coded according to the definition of each affordance and their existence in a tweet. Specifically, the affordance of expression was defined as, ""The disclosure within the tweet serves a cathartic function; the discloser expresses his or her feelings or emotions related to the experience of sexual assault,"" and was coded as 0 = no or 1 = yes, depending on whether the disclosure tweet comprised content that matches the definition. Self-clarification was defined as, ""The disclosure within the tweet serves a function of cognitive processing; the disclosure clarifies the discloser's own thoughts or issues regarding the experience of sexual assault,"" and was coded as 0 = no or 1 = yes. To distinguish self-clarification, from expression, self-clarification was operationalized as the cognitive function of a disclosure and expression was operationalized as the affective function. Specifically, when coding for the affordance of self-clarification, words were specifically examined that conveyed thoughts (e.g., ""I think/thought . . ., I knew/didn't know, etc.""), whereas the process of coding for expression included looking for words that conveyed feelings (e.g., ""I feel/felt [emotion] . . ., I was afraid/sad/angry/etc.""). Social validation was defined as, ""The disclosure within the tweet is included  
Tweets that receive a no = 0 code in the disclosure (filter) category will receive a 0 for each variable thereafter.
Tweets may only be coded as yes = 1 if they are original content of the user; retweets and quoted material do not qualify as self-disclosures.

Relationship development was defined as, ""The disclosure within the tweet includes information about the discloser's desire to stand in solidarity with other victims of sexual assault,"" and was coded as 0 = no or 1 = yes. Finally, social control was defined as, ""The disclosure within the tweet includes specific information about the discloser; the discloser may share information he or she had kept private for a long time, or they may include personal characteristics or demographic information,"" and was coded as 0 = no or 1 = yes. While examinations of sexual explicitness receive attention from present scholars (Dillman Carpentier et al., 2017;Vangeel et al., 2020;Wright & Tokunaga, 2015), the existing literature has not included a measure designed to capture explicitness of sexual assault disclosures on Twitter. The development of a coding scheme for sexual explicitness was guided by other research, in particular, studies examining sex content in the media (Leone, 2002) and men's and women's portrayals in media entertainment (Bleakley et al., 2012). These studies used measures categorizing sexually explicit content on a continuum, ranging from 0 = no sexually explicit content to 1 = somewhat sexually explicit content in the form of kissing on the lips and removal of clothing, to 2 = very sexually explicit content, including fondling and groping behaviors while clothed or partially clothed, and 3 = extremely sexually explicit content such as foreplay behaviors while naked, intercourse, or other sexual penetration or masturbation. For this study, a measure based on this prior research was adapted to be more specific to sexual assault, for the purposes of assessing explicitness of sexual assault disclosures on Twitter. Specific changes that were made to better adapt the prior measures to the topic of sexual assault included using the terms unwanted and nonconsensual to describe the sexual behaviors.
Analytical Procedure
The codebook developed for this study classified measures by characteristics and information content of tweets. Characteristics of the sample were analyzed from publicly available information on each Twitter profile. These qualitative characteristics included network size of each Twitter user and the number of tweets that comprised each single disclosure of sexual assault. Tweet content of sexual assault disclosures served as the broad theme of the codebook, from which more specific categories were established to provide more specific information about each tweet.
The category under the Linguistic characteristic was Explicitness. To analyze explicitness, variations of sexually explicit content within the context of online sexual assault disclosures were examined to determine whether sexual explicitness was included in a tweet. For this study, sexually explicit content ranged from not sexually explicit (e.g., 0 = not explicit disclosure tweets do not refer to any of the behaviors listed below) to somewhat sexually explicit (e.g., 1 = somewhat explicit disclosure tweets refer to unwanted and nonconsensual kissing on the lips and unwanted and nonconsensual removal of clothing), to very sexually explicit (e.g., 2 = very explicit disclosure tweets refer to unwanted and nonconsensual fondling behaviors [e.g., groping, molestation, abusing, assaulting] while clothed or partially clothed), to extremely sexually explicit (e.g., 3 = extremely explicit disclosure tweets refer to unwanted and nonconsensual foreplay behaviors while naked, unwanted and nonconsensual intercourse, or other unwanted and nonconsensual sexual penetration or masturbation).
The coded themes that followed Explicitness were analyzed under Disclosure. These themes included expression, self-clarification, social validation, relationship development, and social control. Each of the themes within the Disclosure category represents one of the five social affordances of Derlega and Grzelak's (1979) functional theory of self-disclosure.
To ensure reliability, two coders randomly coded a subset of 210 of the collected tweets over three rounds. Upon completion of the independent coding of each round, the coders discussed any disagreements. After an acceptable level of reliability was achieved, the collected tweets that were not part of the reliability analysis were single-coded per codebook classifications and definitions. We used Gwet's agreement coefficient (Gwet, 2002) to determine intercoder reliability as it compensates for limitations of other coder reliability statistics (Wongpakaran et al., 2013), including as Cohen's Kappa and Scott's Pi, both of which are sensitive to prevalence (Parker et al., 2013). Given that variables in our study (such as affordances related to social validation and relationship development) demonstrated fairly low prevalence in the data, we relied on Gwet's agreement coefficient. After an acceptable level of reliability was achieved (average Gwet's agreement coefficients across all coding = .93, ranging from .84 to .99), the collected tweets that were not part of the reliability analysis were single-coded per codebook classifications and definition",6989,8163

Sexual violence is a major public health concern, and healthcare providers are in a unique position to offer care and support for survivors. Our study analyzes survivors' stories of sexual violence posted on Twitter in the #MeToo movement between November 29 and December 25, 2017. In analyzing communicative traces that lie within digital data, we read survivors' stories for emotional expressions that create practice. Three themes, informed by survivors of sexual violence reported in our study, included: 1) gaslighting: (re) claiming what I experienced; 2) shame and blame: redefining victimhood and redirecting pain; and 3) bystander: becoming a respectful witness. The practical implications of this piece identify healthcare providers, and in particular OB/GYNs, occupy an important role to create a space where survivors can reclaim their agency, experience, and seek the support they need to heal.
",2021-02-04,Health Communication,Informa UK Limited,"
Sexual violence and rape are major public health concerns. Some form of sexual violence occurs every 98 seconds to an individual over the age of 12 (Morgan & Kena, 2017). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS), there are four types of sexual violence: attempted or completed rape, forceful penetration of someone else, sexual coercion, and unwanted sexual contact (Smith et al., 2018). Intimate partner violence (IPV) includes sexual violence as well as stalking, physical abuse, and psychological hostility (Smith et al., 2018). However, because of the relatively higher incidence of assaultive experiences among individuals with one or more minority status, the epidemiology of instances of sexual violence and/or IPV is complex.
Healthcare providers are in a unique position to empathize, show compassion, and offer resources to support survivors of sexual violence and/or IPV. Our study analyzes survivors' stories of sexual violence posted in the #MeToo movement and identifies the following three themes: 1) gaslighting: (re) claiming what I experienced; 2) shame and blame: redefining victimhood and redirecting pain; and 3) bystander: becoming a respectful witness. In contextualizing how survivors reclaim experiences in the #MeToo movement, healthcare providers' role in the process of healing the physical, mental, and emotional harms caused from sexual violence and the history concerning the silencing of a sexual assault survivor is discussed.
Health communication and the physical, mental, and emotional harms of failing to respond to sexual violence
Healthcare providers occupy a unique space where survivors' stories are heard -potentially breaking the cycle of epistemic wrongs of silencing the survivor. It was not until 2018 that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recognized the importance of screening patients for IPV (Curry et al., 2018) and not until 2019 that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended screening all patients for a history of sexual violence. Harms to the survivor extend beyond gynecological health concerns (Campbell et al., 2002) to mental and emotional harms, including anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorders (Danielson et al., 1998;Golding, 1999). While there are several screening tools that could be used to detect abuse, many of these screenings tools only address violence in the present moment. As has been demonstrated in previous studies, survivors are often reluctant to discuss these experiences.
No survivor's story of sexual violence is the same. An attempt at standardizing protocols to detect sexual violence can retraumatize a patient, especially when a patient refuses to name their experience ""rape."" Harris (2011) found that victims of rape are uncomfortable employing the term ""rape"" because it strips them of agency and control; however, the term also emphasizes that what happened to them was both severe and not their fault. The ambiguity that surrounds what is and is not considered rape, sexual assault, violence, and/or harassment is complex and even more complicated when tied to the language of consent (Harris, 2018(Harris, , 2011)). According to Roeiens et al. (2009), ""The main 'internal barriers' when looking for professional help were formulated as: 'looking for help implicates that you admit that something is wrong,' 'not being aware that psychological violence is violence,' and 'fear of escalation of violence'"" (p. 94). Healthcare providers have an opportunity to create a space for inviting the everyday expressions and words of survivors used to describe their own lived experiences of assault that leads to healing.
#MeToo movement: Prompting empowerment, exclusion, and empathy
In 2006, the MeToo movement, founded by Tarana Burke, encouraged young women of color to seek healing from pain caused by sexual violence, harassment, and/or assault. Drawing upon Burke's own personal experience of sexual violence, the movement's motto is ""empowerment through empathy,"" with the hope that survivors recognize they are not alone and come forward to receive support. Burke's original motivation for the movement was quickly eclipsed on October of 2017 when MeToo became an international hashtag trend on Twitter, tweeted nearly half a million times within 24 hours of Hollywood actress Alyssa Milano's call for #MeToo stories (Gilbert, 2017). Millions of people were drawn together in the wake of this movement -both in support and critical of it.
#MeToo movement is a performance of personal narratives that politicize collective accounts of sexual assault. Critics argue the movement suppresses stories shared by those in marginalized communities and those with identities that do not conform to traditional gender roles. Some question whether or not the #MeToo, as a social media movement, can sustain change as it either (re)positions women as victims (Flores, 2017) or oversimplifies the injustice of systemic sexual violence (Clark-Parsons, 2019). Social media has, as Rentschler (2014) argued, been used in the past by feminists to ""transform rape culture"" by calling out violence against women (p. 79). Clark-Parsons (2019) argued the #MeToo movement created a space for participants to make ""visible"" stories that ""pushed back against discourses that normalize harassment and assault"" (p. 16). In reclaiming one's agency by tweeting ""MeToo,"" participants ""galvanized and materialized a movement for the oppressed"" (Clair et al., 2019, p. 115). But these actions come with a cost of ""re-traumatization, backlash, cooptation, complacency, and the exclusion of those most marginalized victims, especially survivors of color and working-class survivors"" (Clark-Parsons, 2019, p. 16). This has led scholars to question whether the movement is a ""white, heterosexual"" woman's movement (Battaglia et al., 2019;Corrigan, 2019;Hsu, 2019;Leung & Williams, 2019;Mack & McCann, 2018;Tambe, 2018;Winderman, 2019;Zarkov & Davis, 2018).
While there were posts tweeted by participants of various nationalities, ethnicities, and positionalities from marginalized communities within the #MeToo movement, reports by media lacked diverse representation, and, as Tambe (2018) argued, even cultures within the U.S. Exclusion of voices from the conversation led scholars to ask who is permitted to speak and who is permitted to listen (Tambe, 2018;Zarkov & Davis, 2018). Winderman (2019) discussed how anger from white women was permitted and anger from black women was not. Leung and Williams (2019) explained in their study how R. Kelly's victims confronted both race (e.g., the outing of someone within their own community) and gender (e.g., fear of not being believed) when coming forward. However, Hsu (2019) argued that those who received the least amount of attention during the movement were survivors who identify as transgender or incarcerated. Universal categories embedded in discourses within systems of racism, sexism, classism, and homophobia continue to limit the potential of language and the enactment of one's agency to dismantle sexual violence (Battaglia et al., 2019;Harris, 2018Harris, , 2011;;Harris et al., 2019;Mack & McCann, 2018).
The movement itself is impartial to political affiliation, race, gender, sexual identity, and class; however, activists must choose to avoid inflicting divide, indifference or inaction. In endorsing Burke's motto of empathy, activists of the movement should listen to all stories mindful that differences are important. Rodino-Colocino (2018) argued, ""#MeToo's mobilization of empathy counters the othering, distancing, and ultimately, the unequal relations of power that sexual assault symptomatizes and reinforces"" (p. 99). Empathy can prompt the healing process, empower agency, and create transformative change (Rodino-Colocino, 2018). According to Rodino-Colocino (2018), victim-survivors, through empathy, may avoid feelings of shame and blame which often leads one to remain silent.
#MeToo movement: Righting epistemic wrongs of silencing stories of sexual violence
The silence of a victim occurs for many reasons, including a desire to remain anonymous and, almost certainly, the fear that their story will not be believed. Silencing is an epistemic wrong, particularly when an entire group's speech fails to be heard (Dotson, 2011;Kukla, 2014;Miller, 2019;Spivak, 1998). As Lorde (1984Lorde ( /2007, p. 41) , p. 41) reminds us silencing does nothing to protect us. A speech act has no performative force when an audience dismisses the credibility of a speaker (Dotson, 2011;Kukla, 2014;Langton, 1993). Prejudgments of the speaker in the context of sexual violence rely on sexists norms such as: who is entitled to speak, who has the authority to speak, who can demand to be listened to, who is vulnerable, and who must play nice -all which work to delegitimize the agency and credibility of a survivor and even more pronounced for an individual occupying intersectional identities (Collins, 2002;Dotson, 2011;Kukla, 2014). Sexists norms also contribute to dismissing arguments from survivors by deflecting claims concerning one's behavior of the encounter, such as: they were angry, hormonal, or irrational (Kukla, 2014). According to Kukla (2014) this ""dynamic occurs in part because women's claims to sexist treatment aren't taken as building on one another as part of a shared picture of the world in the way that they should be"" (p. 452) causing what Dotson (2011) refers to as epistemic violence -the ""refusal, intentional or unintentional, of an audience to communicatively reciprocate a linguistic exchange owing to pernicious ignorance"" (p. 238). This is what the #MeToo movement acts against. By reclaiming agency and expression, survivors use the platform to share their stories that once were silent.
Gaslighting contributes to the silencing of a speaker. Gaslighting, a concept made popular by the 1944 film Gaslight, occurs when a perpetrator attempts to manipulate a survivor into questioning their reality (Abramson, 2014;Stewart, 2019). Gaslighting affects women more than men, as it often relies on internalized misogynistic tropes that are viewed as ""acceptable""; when gaslighting is effective, it can lead the victim to feel trapped within the sexist stereotypes they were trying to escape (Abramson, 2014). It is a form of sexism that makes a victim question their reality and undermine their experiences, demonstrated clearly in the phenomenon of victim blaming. These accusations of false allegations, which account for only 6.2% of all sexual assault cases (Lisak et al., 2010), are phenomena that contribute to disbelieving a victim via attempting to remove credibility from victims and smother testimonials (Dotson, 2011). Gaslighting is rooted in sexist stereotypes reproduced within rape culture (Brownmiller, 1975), and narratives of gaslighting present within the #MeToo movement are participant's practice of resistance by reclaiming their experience.
Survivors may also suppress their stories for fear of receiving blame, and the resulting feeling of shame for being the recipient of sexual violence. As Stenberg (2018) discussed, ""Shame is particularly 'sticky' in relation to bodies of sexual assault survivors, due to the pervasive trope of victim-blaming in our culture"" (p. 123). The systemic injustice of silencing the victim, due to the blaming of a female victim of rape, has long been established in literature (see Whatley, 1996), yet, the believability of experiences by victims of sexual assault are often foreclosed (Grubb & Harrower, 2009). According to Grubb and Turner (2012), when victims of sexual assault violate traditional gender roles, they are blamed, especially when the audience is men who are more likely to accept rape myths. The onus is on the victim. However, participants of the #MeToo movement, through their testimonials, have an opportunity to resist what Dotson (2011) refers to as ""testimonial quieting"" by sharing their voices and forcing others to listen through widespread disclosure and the support that has followed in the wake of MeToo.
Studies have also found that victim-blaming contributes to whether or not a bystander will intervene. According to Gramazio et al. (2018), victims who were perceived as sexual deviants were more likely to be blamed for being sexually harassed, and this was associated with a decrease in bystander intervention. In a 2017 study conducted by Sundstrom et al. on a college campus, 84% of participants were more likely to take action following the campaign message, ""It's your place to prevent sexual assault; You're not ruining a good time,"" yet during the formative research stage male participants did not feel sexual assault was an issue. Savage et al. (2017) exposed participants to news stories of IPV and found that rarely would an individual perceive violence as a problem; in fact, participants perceived IPV as an individual, not cultural issue and therefore lacked personal responsibility for intervening. An upstander, according to Chapin and Stern (2019), is ""a person who stands up, rather than stands by"" (p. 1); whereas, a bystander can be destructive, causing more harm and emotional distress to a victim by normalizing the behavior of violence or harassment, protecting the person causing harm because of power status, or blaming the target (Clair et al., 2019). The #MeToo movement generated discussion about how to move from observation to intervention, therefore transitioning from a bystander to an upstander. As detailed by Clair et al. (2019), for a bystander's action to be meaningful, they must try to stop the incident, report the incident, or support the survivor. Communication, especially health communication, may help to create upstander programs where individuals become educated about their role in intervening when they observe sexual violence.
Methods
#MeToo is a movement where the once voiceless now force others to listen. It is as Clair et al. (2019) argued, ""a discourse alive with meaning and materiality, expressing the pain and organizing the resistance to sexual harassment"" (p. 123). Clair et al. (2019) posited a theoretical framework referred to as DREAM -in that -discourse is action that illuminates a historically ignored reality through expressive activities to manifest change. We examine how the expressions posted from participants in the #MeToo movement invite a space to reclaim agency and experience by exposing the reality of sexual assault that was for far too long obscured by rape culture and the normalization of sexual violence. Following this framework, we asked: 1) What can we learn from the expressions of #MeToo participants' stories of sexual violence in reclaiming their experience and agency even following years of silence, and 2) In what ways can we create change within the health communication community from listening to survivors' stories of sexual violence?
In an effort to answer these questions, we conducted a discourse analysis of 243 #MeToo tweets posted between November 29 and December 25, 2017. The original set included 390,000 #MeToo tweets posted between November 29 and December 25, 2017 provided by an open access data archiving platform (Turner, 2018). From this set, we filtered for duplicates and deleted replicate tweets, and also deleted tweets with the ""at"" symbol as these regularly led to news articles rather than personal stories leaving a total of 94,838 tweets. The first two authors conducted a multi-layer coding process. We manually opencoded the first 300 tweets to identify themes from the data set (Charmaz, 2014). The data set was then divided among all the authors where we systematically attended to the following eight themes that we titled: experience, silence, movement, backlash, gaslighting, victim shaming, victim blaming, and bystander. The current study reports on the latter four themes. Experience tweets were personal stories of individuals' experience of sexual assault, rape, harassment, and/or violence that was unique to the survivor. Tweets about silence included any mention of not speaking up, staying silent, and/or the normalizing of sexual violence. Movement tweets involved posts that discussed the power of the #MeToo movement for social justice and change. Any tweet that denigrated or was critical of the #MeToo movement was coded as backlash. Gaslighting was any post from a survivor who was told that they made the experience up, it was not that bad, they are crazy, or that they would not be believed. Victim shaming tweets included posts describing the internalization of shame and guilt a victim perceived of themselves. Tweets about victim blaming were stories of societal or personal accounts that identified the survivor bearing blame/ responsibility for the assault. Bystander tweets were any post discussing personal experiences of bystander interventions. Following our coding of 94,838 tweets into categories, we confirmed that the final tweets reported in our study were still publicly available on Twitter in January of 2020. Still, in order to protect the privacy of the survivor, we do not use any Twitter handles in our findings. Totals for each category of tweets were the following: experience: 186; silence: 258; movement: 367; backlash: 248; gaslighting: 119; victim shaming: 40; victim blaming: 62; and bystander: 43. Tweets excluded during manually coded categories were repeated tweets that we were unable to filter, news articles, tweets unrelated to the #MeToo movement, and tweets no longer available on Twitter.
Digital data from the #MeToo movement provides a glimpse into the ways communities restory their social realities and identities. With this in mind, we also utilized Ellingson and Sotirin (2020) idea about becoming -with digital data to reflexively engage in the discourse marked with emotional expressions that create activity and material realities. We explored what Airoldi (2018) referred to as ""dispersed communicative traces"" among a community of survivors of sexual violence (p. 662). The hashtag MeToo offers a common language developed into a ""meta-field"" that brings people together in a shared digital space (Airoldi, 2018). Findings report the following themes: 1) gaslighting: (re)claiming what I experienced; 2) shame and blame: redefining victimhood and redirecting pain; and 3) bystander: becoming a respectful witness.
Analysis

Gaslighting: (Re)claiming what I experienced
""Well, that's not so bad, I mean it wasn't rape -said after I shared my own #Metoo""
Participants, in an effort to raise awareness and reclaim their experiences, called attention to strategic language games employed by those who gaslight their victims (or those who threaten the patriarchal status quo) to remain silent. Gaslighting was used as a form of emotional manipulation characterized as purposeful and explicit or unconscious and implicit -either way -discourse undeniably harmful to an agent's sense of morality. In the tweets that follow, gaslighting was exposed to illustrate its use to silence disputes, disagreements, or challenges prior to an agent reporting abuse. The aim was also to discredit another's spoken word and, in turn, their sense as the knower of their own experience. When gaslighting was successful, a survivor became an object unto themselves through the lens of another who attempted to make them doubt themself and their reality:
They sometimes call this kinda talk ""Gaslighting."" This is also an example of what we called ""Crazy Making"" at the women's shelters. It's both Specific-sentence itself & General-larger pattern of Abusive Behavior, aka: ""The Continuum.""
As another participant shared, ""Being doubted and dismissed was a form of #abuse that affected this woman's career."" Another tweeted, ""As a friend after being raped you told me I was crazy, and you didn't want to be like me."" One participant explained how this manipulative discourse was often used strategically to lessen the severity of harassment: This is heart breaking . . . I cried because of the phrases ""You should take it as a compliment"" ""He was just joking"" and ""He didn't mean it that way"" These are things we have all heard. These are things that are wrong. These are things that should be better.
Gaslighting was, as another participant said, ""psychological abuse"" that ""is often a cleverly orchestrated ploy to win trust, but it can often lead to severe physical consequences."" Gaslighting was its own form of violence used by oppressors to silence, alienate, and make a survivor feel alone: I learned: modes of speech that: -SHIFT BLAME/-Try to TETHER YOU to ACTIONS OF ANOTHER are TOOLS OF ABUSE in abusive relationships of ALL KINDS. Abusers AIM TO ISOLATE. Make you feel SMALL. I realized that: I AM NOT ALONE in HOW I was manipulated. I thought that this was the best I could do. For months he convinced me that he was my ""best friend"" And I . . . Believed every stupid word. I was so lonely and wanted friendship that I let him take advantage of me like this.
Black women who have been victimized by the same black men who are overly policed have been socialized to believe their oppression isn't as highly regarded as their oppressors' challenges, thus, to remain silent.
Yesterday I was insulted and bullied by a family member who abused me in my childhood after my mother's funeral. I was hurt and I was bruised. This is why abuse survivors tell their stories because abuse is real, especially in the Black community where there is denial.
On a micro-level, gaslighting was employed discursively to disempower, isolate, and trivialize abuse in an effort to dismantle a survivor's moral standings. On a macro-level, this language reinforced cultural scripts of surveillance and control perpetuated by societal fear of reporting an aggressor, which as participants above explained was even more challenging for those whose stories expose meanings from intersectional identities positioned within marginalized communities.
Within participants' narratives, their own vulnerabilities/ risks were exposed in the sharing of their experiences. The discursive became material. The following stories illustrated how prejudicial stereotypes and power inequalities reinforced gaslighting which perpetuates cultural and systemic norms concerning who is and is not permitted to report their abuser. For example:
Authority person verbally harass u in closed room incl saying they can say whatever since no witness. U report it 2 higher authorities, refuse 2 act since abuser denies it happens 2 men by women isn't & doesn't have 2 be sexual harassment=harassment no matter what. I am a victim. [sic] In another participant's tweet regarding an experience that occurred in medical school, this type of behavior was to be tolerated as a way to ""adapt:"" I was sexually harassed/touched. A classmate grabbed my breast in a hallway. Admin called it ""adapting to MY 'situation'."" A faculty member pinched my leg in front of classmates, teased my being #trans. I didn't dare bother reporting.
In addition to who is permitted to report abusive behavior was also who is permitted to be believed. For example, a participant was asked, ""Did this really happen?"" and went on to explain that ""My boss sent me to a psychiatrist who doubted me."" And yet there was another example where a counselor disbelieved a survivor's story:
The reason my therapist thinks I'm faking is because I didn't get abused as a kid but a teenager by a trusted person and I've refused to talk about what happened. I don't trust anyone, especially MEN!! They are the WORST. All I'll say is #MeToo
The above participants were doubted by those in their immediate social circles and then again after they sought help from a healthcare provider. Those in a position of power used their power to delegitimize claims undermining the survivor's sense of agency and reinforcing sexist norms.
Gaslighting has always been an instrument of the oppressor. If these were the reactions to the stories that have been shared, then, there is no surprise why survivors don't come forward with their narratives of sexual violence. As one participant said, ""We're so used to our stories falling on deaf ears, that we can barely believe that we're being believed."" Another wrote, ""The folks who I know are experiencing this on a daily, the women who are sitting in the cages right now who have told us what has happened to them . . . "" This is an epistemic injustice that elicits a space for victim shaming and blaming, which the participants below expanded upon:
We don't tell immediately because we're afraid no one will believe us. When we do tell we're not believed. No one believes us because then we'd all have to admit there is a problem. Disbelief and victim shaming is better than awareness. This is the bigger problem.
YOU want to know why don't we tell sooner, or at all? We know YOU don't want to believe it, that YOU will ask if we're sure it really happened, & that YOU will be very upset by this. We don't know how to tell YOU, when YOU keep making it about YOU.
When it comes down 2 your word against his, unless you r in a floor-length skirt, completely sober, on your way back from school & in the presence of 3 witnesses who can film the attack & report it to cops within a 10-minute time-frame, then u can forget about justice.
As participants explained, when someone prejudges a survivor even prior to hearing their story, why would they choose to share it? Gaslighting reinforced survivors' sense of a void of moral agency and nihilism, but the #MeToo movement created a space for these stories to be heard:
I am reassessing what the fuck I am being told or shown. Also, I will not tolerate somebody claiming to know what the fuck I experienced when it wasn't fucking them who(m?) experienced it!! Example: ""That's bullshit, you weren't child-raped."" My response: FUCK YOU. #MeToo
Shame and blame: Redefining victimhood and redirecting pain
""Shame is like a wound that is never exposed and therefore never heals"" #MeToo participants offered reflections for overcoming shame, an internal feeling of guilt, as a way to redefine ""their"" victimhood, and also invited a space to redirect pain caused by the myth that the victim is to blame. Shame acted as an internal emotional struggle by participants in the following tweets. As participants entered into conversations with themselves about shame, they acknowledged the pervasive and cruel messages rape culture reinforced, such that, women were responsible for avoiding sexual assault while also redefining what it means to be a victim. For instance, one participant commented, ""I'm Mortified by All of this! How Could ANYONE Let This SLIDE? Boys Will Be Boys? She Was Asking For It? I want, ugh, I take?"" Shame, in comparison to gaslighting, was deficient of moral agency. By reclaiming their stories, participants reclaimed their agency. But this was not without struggle, as one participant posted, ""It took a LONG time to understand that it wasn't my fault & I still struggle with relationships because of it,"" and another participant posted, ""Being too afraid to tell anyone because you're scared people will think it was your fault."" The first step in redefining victimhood was ""coming out"" and ""naming"" the experience, which was a common thread in the following tweets: I never wanted to say anything because I felt embarrassed (I don't know why) I don't want anyone to reply to me about it or ask if I'm ok because I'm fine, but just feel so guilty every time someone says it and I don't, so yeah, #MeToo I feel like it's my own fault even tho it wasn't. It never will be either. I said no, multiple times. It's NOT my fault. #MeToo Another participant argued that ""survivors are not 'victims'"" and explained, ""anyone who thinks that because we share our stories means we can't get past them doesn't understand that one doesn't equal the other."" In naming survivors as victims, individuals are positioned in paternalistic ways and their stories become disempowered along with their agency. Yet another participant used the term to demand action, ""This world constantly makes me feel like I am at fault for what happened to me. We need reform and we need it now."" Survivor stories in the #MeToo movement dispelled myths of victimhood often entrenched in the messages generated in systemic, cultural guises of rape culture. Some participants went further and advocated for policy changes:
End statutes of limitation on sexual assault allegations/charges. Victims deal with the guilt, hurt, shame, fear, pain, for the rest of their lives. Perpetrators should be able to be prosecuted for the rest of theirs.
Processing trauma takes time, as the participant above suggested. The legal system fails to allow survivors time to even heal before the time to report is foreclosed. Furthermore, reporting is not at all accurate as many rape kits are never completed, abandoned or never touched, leaving the report to remain unsolved. In 1990, the Clery Act was instituted to require institutions of higher education to report crimes on campus, and under Title IX college personnel are required to report any incidents of sexual misconduct. Despite this, the system has continually failed victims of sexual violence by protecting the institution, not the survivor of sexual violence.
#MeToo movement created a space for participants to redefine what it means to be a victim, in that, agency was reclaimed, and abuse was transferred onto those who were the source of the pain. As the following participant wrote, ""We are only victims if we let it continue to victimize us"" and explained, ""I was sexually assaulted, but I refuse to let it define me as a woman and as a human. The day women band together the men of this world will never know what hit them."" The following participants continue to discuss how to redirect pain:
It's as though women have, for the first time, put the anger and shame where it belongs -not on themselves, but on the person who has victimized them.
There is no shame. I am a rape survivor, and for too long I've been silent about the ensuing sexual assaults that occurred by other people because I had been disempowered. I'm not prey, I'm not ashamed, and I'm not silent anymore. Thank you
The last participant reclaimed moral agency -by taking back the subject position, refusing to internalize shame, and speaking out against the injustice. Shame and blame were not mutually exclusive emotions revealed in participants' tweets. But unlike shame, blame was often triggered by either perceived or direct external judgments reverted back upon the self. In the following tweets, both of these emotions were discussed by participants: I am like many women who were raped and then shamed into taking the blame as their own fault. No matter how you dress, where you hang out or your popularity, saying no means no #MeToo
We need to stop blaming and shaming women for men's actions. All the women who have bravely come forward and have taken a stand took time to do so due to the cycle of power and control that plays a role in abuse.
These participants acknowledged and called for action to stop dominant scripts reproduced by rape culture and myths that promote victim shaming and blaming.
Participants exposed how dominant rape culture scripts often situated the ""perfect"" victim in traditional gender roles excluding gender nonconforming identities. One participant called out this injustice and tweeted, ""This is dangerous rape culture rhetoric. Do not blame women for the actions of men."" As the participants below explained, an ""imperfect"" victim becomes the target of exploitation:
Attempts to excuse their reprehensible actions -""I was drunk"" ""I misread the signals,"" or ""It was a long time ago, I don't recall"" -all BULLSHIT. Because survivors of sexual abuse and harassment and their loved ones remember. #MeToo Great piece on #metoo. And a great reminder that #victimblaming is such a huge part of society, that 'imperfect victims' can feel disempowered to speak out as they may face character assassination. Abusers can prey on and exploit 'imperfect' status. I can't believe it's about to be 2018 and people are still telling me I deserve all the times I've been sexually assaulted because of the pictures I post online.
Woman reports a predator anonymously. ""Anonymous accusations aren't credible!"" Woman reports under her name. ""She just wants fame and attention . . . "" Woman reports years after the attack. ""Why did she wait so long?!"" Woman reports immediately. ""What was she drinking/wearing/doing?"" Fear of being blamed, as the last partici",6917,7973
10.1177/08862605211016343,,,False,Vanessa Woodward Griffin,Explaining the Why in #WhyIDidntReport: An Examination of Common Barriers to Formal Disclosure of Sexual Assault in College Students,"
Within the current study, we examined themes of college students' reasons for choosing not to formally disclose (report) sexual assault. To complete this objective, we examined tweets (n = 1,297) that used the WhyIDidntReport hashtag in which a user also made reference (within the same thread) to being enrolled at a college or university during the time (and aftermath) of the assault. We deemed Twitter a particularly valuable platform, offering insight into the hidden figure of crime, as users described events, feelings, and perceptions after the event that led to them not formally disclosing. Further, it provides a large sample of cases of women and men who recognize their assault as an assault (at least in hindsight), while also
",2021-05-11,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,SAGE Publications,"Introduction
Formal disclosure 1 of sexual assault has become a prevalent topic of research and policy, particularly on college campuses. The risk of sexual assault for college-aged women (that is, 18-25), is approximately three times that of the female population younger than 18 and older than 25 (Sinozich & Langton, 2014). Further, sexual assault is vastly underreported across all age groups, with nonreporting estimates ranging from 40-60% (Morgan & Oudekerk, 2019;Morgan & Truman, 2019;Rennison, 2002); yet, formal disclosure of sexual assault has yielded particularly low rates for college students, from 5% or less (Fisher et al., 2003;Koss et al., 1987) up to 17% (Sloan et al., 1997).
With some exceptions, past research on sexual assault reporting has focused predominantly on subsets of close-ended victimization surveys of college-aged women. Thus, there is a need for further research on the process of formal and informal disclosure through more open-ended mediums. To complete this objective, it was necessary to have a large sample of open-ended testaments of individuals who-at the very least in hindsightrecognized a past event as a form of sexual assault. For purposes of this study, we examined Tweets of users who described an assault (or the aftermath of an assault) that occurred while enrolled at universities and colleges, and also used the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport and its variations (#IDidNotReport, #IDidntReport, & #WhyIDidNotReport).
#WhyIDidn'tReport originated as a response to President Donald Trump's tweet regarding Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault accusations against Brett Kavanaugh. Specifically, preceding Christine Blasey Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, President Trump took to Twitter to question the plausibility of Dr Ford's assertions stating that if it ""was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authoritiesâ€¦"" (Trump, 2018). This prompted a response from survivors of sexual violence, using the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport to explain the complexities of the reporting process and its outcomes (actual and anticipated). According to Mosbergen (2018), during the time of this social movement, there was a 42% uptick in calls to the National Sexual Assault Hotline days after initial use of the hashtag (Mosbergen, 2018).
While powerful, #WhyIDidntReport builds on a foundation of hashtag feminism grounded within the #MeToo movement. In response to these social movements, researchers have found Twitter and other social media platforms to be valuable data sources for research on sexual-violence discourse, as it offers some depth and tremendous breadth into the experiences of a typically hard-to-access population (Bogen et al., 2018;Cravens et al., 2015;PettyJohn et al., 2019;Storer et al., 2018;Stubbs-Richardson et al., 2018). We believe this particular event of hashtag feminism provides insight into the disclosure processes among college-aged women and men, as well as the university culture and role of the institution in the process of informal and formal disclosure of college students.
Background

Sexual Assault in College
Research on sexual assault of college students has demonstrated its prevalence; however, establishing a rate of sexual assault amongst any population is challenging, given the varying operational definitions of sexual assault, timeline of data collection, sampling techniques, and sample size. For instance, when defining sexual assault as all forms of attempted or completed assault, research has demonstrated that approximately 15-25% of college women who experience sexual assault is (Fisher et al., 2000;Jordan et al., 2014;Krebs et al., 2007;Sinozich & Langton, 2014) compared to about 6% of college men (Krebs et al., 2007).
Studies have revealed mixed results on the effect of race on sexual assault victimization, with some demonstrating higher rates for white women (Koss et al.,1987;Krebs et al., 2009), while other studies have yielded higher risks for racial and ethnic minorities (Coulter et al., 2017;Gross et al., 2006;Porter & Williams, 2011). Moreover, those with physical disabilities and those who identify as LGBTQI (Porter &Williams, 2011) also may be at higher risk. Moreover, memberships in Greek organizations are associated with higher risk of both sexual assault perpetration and victimization (Martinez et al., 2018;Mellins et al., 2017). As previously stated, the majority of college students who experience sexual violence never formally report the assault to police, with some statistics showing that as few as 5% of college women report their assault to police (Belknap, 2010). Research has demonstrated that some of the most common reasons include fear of retaliation (by offender or others); not perceiving the assault as criminal (or, if perceiving it as a criminal act, not seeing it as a serious one); not classifying the assault as any form of sexual assault (Koss et al., 1987); viewing the assault as more personal and wanting to avoid getting others involved, or believing if they did report to law enforcement, that officers would not (or could not) take action against an alleged perpetrator (Fisher et al., 2003;Morgan & Oudekerk, 2019;Orchowski et al., 2013;Zinzow & Thompson, 2011). While reluctance to report stems from a belief that doing so will result in negative outcomes, this is further complicated by survivors' fear of being blamed, dismissed, and/or stigmatized (Fisher et al., 2003;Sable et al., 2006;Walsh et al., 2010), as well as by situational factors of the assault, including alcohol use and having a relationship with the offender (Orchowski et al., 2013).
Disclosure Process and Campus Culture
Frameworks to explain reporting and disclosure have vastly distinct perspectives that rely upon individual, situational, and/or broad social foci. In their Disclosure Process Model, Chaudoir and Fisher (2010) argued that disclosure is continual, and is affected by avoidance or approach motivations, which vary due to mediating and moderating factors. The disclosure process can occur within one event or over time. An individual may give a small bit of concealed information as a trial of sorts, and that past disclosure for one event may affect disclosure for a later event. Chaudoir and Quinn (2010) found that for college students revealing stigmatized identities, there were two primary classifications of motivation: egosystem (self) and ecosystem (others-external).
Within their theory of Communication Privacy Management Theory (CPMT), Petronio (2002Petronio ( , 2004) ) has argued that individuals use metaphorical boundaries to discern between private and public information. Determining whether to disclose requires a calculus using a ""rule-based management system"" (Petronio, 2002(Petronio, , 2004)), and when disclosures are high risk, individuals'boundary management is higher (Kennedy-Lightsey et al., 2012), which may result in increased selectivity in whom they confide. Those seeking to disclose often seek others with similar experiences, as well as certain personality characteristics that suggest their reactions will be supportive and caring (Lewis et al., 2011;Pluretti & Chesebro, 2015). In their study examining disclosure rationales for sexual assault victims within a CPMT framework, Pluretti and Chesebro (2015) found three overarching themes within individuals' rationales to disclose: feeling urgency to disclose after an assault, wanting to be forthright, or seeking support from a disclosure recipient.
The risks and boundary management of disclosure can also be considered in context of stigmatization. For instance, within their Intimate Partner Violence Stigmatization (IPV Stigmatization) model, Overstreet and Quinn posit that three constructs are interwoven into decisions of victims to seek help. Cultural stigma refers to negative cultural beliefs embedded in society; anticipated stigma focuses on the anticipated negative reactions of others to disclosure; andstigma internalization refers to the victims' internalization of negative beliefs (Overstreet & Quinn, 2013). IPV Stigmatization examines societal and victim beliefs of myths as well as the anticipated stigma of reporting (Storer et al., 2018). Research has demonstrated that anticipated stigma significantly influences victims' decisions of disclosure (Miller et al., 2011), and nondisclosure, in turn, increases maladaptive coping and the likelihood of revictimization.
The majority of individuals who experience sexual assault disclose informally to at least one source, and those who disclose most often do so to approximately three sources (Ahrens et al., 2007;Ullman & Filipas, 2001a). Disclosure often serves as a precursor to formal reporting, as women more frequently disclose informally prior to reporting to the police (Ruback et al., 1984). Thus, social reactions may negatively or positively affect the likelihood of reporting victimization to the police. Typically, survivors receive a mix of both negative and positive social reactions (Starzynski et al., 2005). Those who disclose most often tell member(s) of their informal social networks including family, friends, and significant others (Ahrens et al., 2007;Fisher et al., 2003;Golding et al., 1989;Ullman, 1996). Disclosing to support services is considerably less common; however, those who choose to, most often do so for aid in their physical and mental health, and frequently wait until long after they were assaulted (Sable et al., 2006). The disclosure of traumatic events, likesexual assault, can be therapeutic (Botta & Pingree, 1997) and can aid in the creation of an informal social support network, which along with mental health treatment, can have a positive effect on posttraumatic growth (Hassija & Turchik, 2016), particularly when reactions are positive (Borja et al., 2006) and disclosures are informal (Ahrens et al., 2009;Starzynski et al., 2007;Ullman, 1996).
Studies on sexual assault within college-student populations have focused predominantly on internal barriers to formal disclosure, such as self-blame, minimization of the assault, and internalized stigma (Miller et al., 2011;Orchowski et al., 2013;Tillman et al., 2010;Zinzow & Thompson, 2011) and the campus environment itself. For instance, while reasons for underreporting are overall similar for college women and other adult women, Fisher (2000) noted one markedly distinct reason college women did not formally report their completed or attempted sexual assault: they were unsure how to do so.
Normalizing sexual violence is an integral part of the campus culture, ostensibly inevitable when its student culture has ingrained partying (Armstrong et al., 2006). Moreover, a culture that subscribes to the notion of ""real rape,"" is less likely to recognize physically nonviolent events as sexual assault (Kolivas & Gross, 2007). Cultures that recognize sexual assault solely in the confines of stereotypical rape are unable to depart from these traditional factors of physical violence, an unknown offender, and victim resistance (Estrich, 1987;Koss et al., 1987;Sasson & Paul, 2014). From the Classic Rape theory perspective, five factors may increase the likelihood of reporting: unlawful entry, weapon use, victim injury, physical resistance, and no prior relationship between the victim and offender (Clay-Warner & McMahon-Howard, 2009;Ryan, 2011;Williams, 1984). Thus, any narrative of sexual violence that does not adhere to the traditional script may be met with disregard, signifying that those experiences just simply do not meet the standards of real rape (Clay-Warner & McMahon-Howard, 2009). This is particularly harmful within the disclosure process, as disclosure recipients' responses go beyond the scope of individual reaction and guidance. Further, the reactions often signify to the discloser cultural norms and beliefs surrounding the criminal event (Clay-Warner & McMahon-Howard, 2009;Ruback et al., 1984). Ruback et al.'s (1984) model of help-seeking proposes that not only do others provide direct advice to victims, but they also inform victims of norms regarding the definition and severity of a criminal event.
Situational Factors and Sexual Assault Disclosure
Research has also demonstrated the importance of considering situational factors within the disclosure process, as these can affect the continued disclosure of assault. For instance, how a survivor perceives responses from individuals to whom they initially disclose (Clark et al., 2010;Miller et al., 2011), as well as whether a survivor and/or a discloser recipient is subscribing to rape myths (Paul, Kehn et al., 2014). Another factor that decreases the likelihood of continued disclosure is the time between an assault and first disclosure (Dworkin & Allen, 2018), as timely and positive intervention is important for sexual assault survivors' long-term psychological health (Borja et al., 2006).
Recipients of sexual violence disclosure have great influence over survivors' feelings as well as their subsequent actions (Pluretti & Chesebro, 2015). Sexual assault victims often experience negative reactions to disclosure (Herman, 2005). In one study, women who disclosed sexual assault to family and friends had predominantly negative reactions, including encouraging secrecy, victim blaming, and minimizing the seriousness of the assault. These types of negative social reactions to disclosure of sexual assault, even those that are ""well intentioned"" can have a negative psychological impact and increase self-blame (Ahrens, 2006). However, most often, survivors interpret social reactions positively (Campbell et al., 2001;Dworkin & Allen, 2018;Lorenz et al., 2018), particularly when a survivor was female (Lorenz et al., 2018), and reactions tend to be more positive with more in-depth disclosures (Ullman & Filipas, 2001b).
From a formal reporting perspective, Black's (1976Black's ( /2010Black's ( , 2000) ) theory of the behavior of law is a common framework to examine variation in individuals' mobilization of law. Black developed what is known as pure sociology: examining a social system to study human behavior through its structural artifacts (in this case, law) that embodied collective behavior. Thus, Black contended that by measuring the products of social action, one could examine a more objective measurable approach to studying human behavior. He purported that law is a dynamic and quantifiable means of social control that vary across space and time and are contingent upon five situational dimensions of social life: Stratification, the vertical aspect(victim and offender demographics representative of their status and their interaction), Morphology, the horizontal aspect (victim-offender relationship and the victim's and offender's relationship with others), Culture (victim and offender level of education and the interaction of the two), Organization (the frequency and perceived commonality of similar offenders), and Social Control (when and where an offense occurred).By quantifying each and examining its direction and location, one could explain the variance in the mobilization of the legal system. Black's theory has been met with some controversy (Kuo et al., 2012), and studies that have tested the theory (wholly or partially) have yielded mixed results, particularly in context of sexual violence reporting (Brooks-Hay, 2020;Clay-Warner & McMahon-Howard, 2009). Clay-Warner and McMahon-Howard (2009) tested Black's theory alongside classic rape theory by examining cases of rape and attempted rape within the NCVS. The researchers found that the violence/seriousness of the incident had a significant effect on reporting, which coincides with past research (Felson et al., 1999;Fisher et al., 2003) and supports the stereotypes of ""classic rape."" This is often because victims are able to recognize an event was an assault when it fits a stereotypical description indicating an assault actually occurred.
Similar situational factors have also demonstrated significant effects on social reactions to sexual assault. In line with the relational distance element of morphology (that is, the relationship between the victim and the offender): survivors of sexual assault are less likely to report an offender if they have a prior relationship with them (Gartner & Macmillan, 1995;Jones et al., 2009) and more likely disclose to family, friends, and professional service providers if their attacker was a stranger (Ullman & Siegel, 1993). Further, victims of interpersonal sexual assault are particularly prone to negative reactions (Kennedy & Prock, 2018), as disclosure recipients were more likely to react positively (that is recommended contacting health professionals) when an assault was acquaintance-based rather than when it was intimate-partner based (Suzuki & Bonner, 2017).
Black's definition of stratification is, from a macro perspective, the presence of inequality within a society. He argued that the presence of law is more frequent for those societies with greater inequality and would serve those who were of higher stature. From a micro perspective, stratification can be conceptualized as a victim's social status (age, gender, race, socioeconomic), as well as how a victim's social status compares to that of an offender's (Kuo et al., 2012). Moreover, stratification can be further contextualized with Black's tenet of culture when examining victimization on college campuses, as education levels may attribute more significantly to social hierarchies within a university environment.
Social Media, Disclosure, and Sexual Violence
Social media has provided a rich data source in understanding sexual violence from victims' perspectives as well as recording social movements in real time (Storer et al., 2018). Moreover, social media platforms record the process of disclosure and social reactions to said disclosure (Tichon & Shapiro, 2003), allowing others to observe these interactions, which ostensibly should improve observers' understanding of sexual violence (Overstreet & Quinn, 2013;Storer et al., 2018).
Twitter, in particular, provides a valuable platform in responding to highprofile events of sexual violence that allow researchers to observe ""the convergence of public and personal discourse"" (Bogen & Orchowski, 2019). Researchers across multiple disciplines have used Twitter as a data source since the company's founding in 2006, with some of the first studies examining public and political sentiment (Tumasjan et al., 2011). Most notably, however, has been public health research using Twitter to increase awareness of public health concerns (Thackeray et al., 2013), as well as a surveillance tool for chronic and acute ailments (Aramaki et al., 2011;Eichstaedt et al., 2015;Paul & Dredze, 2011;Paul, Dredze, & Broniatowski, 2014;Sinnenberg et al., 2017) and mental health disorders (Coppersmith et al., 2014(Coppersmith et al., , 2015;;O'dea et al., 2017).
Sexual assault hashtags are used to help dispel myths and victim blaming, challenge patriarchal views, and are used as a form of ""hashtag feminism"" (Bogen & Orchowski, 2019;Keller et al., 2018;Mendes et al., 2018;Stubbs-Richardson et al., 2018) as well as ""cyber justice"" (O'Neill, 2018;Powell, 2015;Sills et al., 2016). The first notable hashtag regarding sexual assault was #NotOkay in response to the released recording of President Trump and Billy Bush during the 2016 election (Bogen et al., 2019;PettyJohn et al., 2019), which was followed by the #MeToo movement. Researchers have also examined the discussion of the aftermath of sexual violence within social media, including interpersonal violence (#WhyIStayed and #WhyILeft) (Cravens et al., 2015;Storer et al., 2018) and sexual assault reporting (#BeenRapedNeverReported) (Keller et al., 2018;Mendes et al., 2018).
It may seem contradictory to assess why victims of sexual assault did not disclose by studying online, informal disclosures. Posting about a sexual assault on social media or other online platforms is certainly a method of disclosure that involves both the initial act of disclosure along with social reactions from disclosure recipients (Tichon & Shapiro, 2003). However, the Internet can create what Suler (2004Suler ( , 2005) ) referred to as the ""online disinhibition effect"" (p. 321). This is particularly evident within anonymous platforms, as one is able to seek social support with a lower risk of stigmatization (Andalibi et al., 2016), allowing those who are unable to disclose in ""real life"" to disclose to others in a virtual platform (O'Neill, 2018), which most often, victims seek for social support (Moors & Webber, 2013;Tichon& Shapiro, 2003) and have reported the virtual disclosure to have a ""fundamental impact on interpersonal communication"" (Walther & Parks, 2002). Online disclosers may also be seeking support from other disclosers, which can be a symbiotic process of support.
Methods
The purpose of the current study is to examine common themes in reasons why college students chose not to formally disclose a sexual assault. We examined tweets that used the WhyIDidntreport hashtag in which a user also made reference (within the same thread) to being enrolled at a college or university during the time (and aftermath) of they were assaulted. Twitter is a particularly valuable platform that could provide insight into the dark figure of crime(also referred to as the hidden figure of crime 3 ; Biderman & Reiss, 1967), as users described events, feelings, and perceptions after the event that led to them choosing not to formally disclose. Further, it provides a large sample of cases of women and men who experienced sexual assault while enrolled at a university or college, and also (at least by the time of the social media disclosure) recognize their assault as an assault, while also providing open-ended, unstructured explanations of their rationales and motivations.
Data Source and Collection
Twitter is a social media and networking platform that allows users to microblog by limiting tweets to 140 characters or fewer (Ash et al., 2017). While popular among Internet-using adults (24% are on Twitter), it is particularly valuable when studying young adults, as 45% of 18-to-24-yearolds are Twitter users (Greenwood et al., 2016;Smith & Anderson, 2018). Race and gender of Twitter users is relatively representative of the USadult population; however, Twitter users have a higher income and education when compared to the general USadult population (Wojcik & Hughes, 2019).
Using Twitter Advanced Search (Garrett & Hassan, 2019), we collected users' tweets (and threads) that included the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport and its variations (#IDidNotReport, #IDidntReport, & #WhyIDidNotReport) and words associated with college (university, college, and campus). Once we searched for tweets, these were then selected and imported into text files, which were then converted to Excel files. Tweets that were continued on threads were manually collected and paired with the initial tweet, and then we reclassified the thread as a single tweet. Each tweet (or thread) was then classified as a single case within NVivo, so that each tweet could be analyzed independently from other tweets.
The timeframe of tweets used in this study was April 2014 to June 2019. Data were initially collected in December 2018; however, we continued adding tweets using this hashtag until June 2019. This approach is distinct from other studies using Twitter data in that we examined tweets historically over a long period of time (from April 2014 to June 2019), examining tweets that occurred any time before the start and up to eight months after the height of the movement. 3  Our initial data included 1,896tweets. We then excluded those that were duplicates, meaning they showed up twice because they included more than one keyword or hashtag (n = 24 tweets). We also excluded those that were inapplicable: general reflections of the news at that time, Christine Blasey Ford, Brett Kavanaugh, or the hashtag itself (n = 155), new source tweets (n = 54), and advertisements (n = 8). We also excluded any tweets that did not discuss a Twitter user's own experience (n = 60) (that is, they discussed the experience of a friend or family member). (n = 60) or those that discussed experiences which did not occur while attending college (n = 297). Lastly, one tweet was excluded because it was not in English. Collectively, 599 tweets were excluded, resulting in a final sample of 1,297 tweets.
Analytic Technique
We used an exploratory approach and thematic analysis (Anderson, 2007;Lune & Berg, 2016), which occurred within multiple iterations, and has been purported as an appropriate method and analysis for succinct units of content (Cravens et al., 2015;Schreier, 2012). First, the researchers examined a subset of tweets (n = 400) to establish predominant themes (Lee et al., 2014). Within the first iteration, common themes were noted broadly by each researcher, and then these were discussed within a peer debriefing. At this time, we established general themes with two approaches: the focus of the tweet and the reasons for not formally reporting or formally disclosing. The focus of the tweet included six general themes: offender information, victim information, disclosure experiences (formal and informal), event information, and victim-offender information. Reasons for not formally reporting or disclosing included negative emotions (that is, fear, shame), not being aware they were sexually assaulted, fear of not being believed, the social status of a respondent or an offender, other personal issues, and negative direct or vicarious experiences with authorities. In the next iteration, one researcher (R1) used NVivo to establish more specific patterns and themes within each of the aforementioned general themes focusing on reasons of not formally reporting or disclosing, including offender status, victim status, victim-offender relationship, administrators and/or police, family, friends, and acquaintances, as well as specific internalized emotions such as self-blame, fear, and shame, as well as anticipated or actual outcomes of both informal and formal disclosure, including blame, disbelief, dismissal, and shame. The other two researchers (R2 & R3) reviewed these classifications to examine discrepancies and other latent patterns. This was followed by peer debriefing, in which the broad themes were discussed and confirmed. Using these themes, we then established our coding scheme by reframing our thematic approach in context of obstacles to formal disclosure or continuing with a formal disclosure process (that is pressing charges). We then reclassified our broad themes by examining direct and indirect barriers to formal disclosure of sexual assault. These variables were then operationalized (Krippendorff, 2004(Krippendorff, , 2009;;Stemler,2015) and subthemes were classified under each broad theme. Once these themes and subthemes were established, one researcher (R1) coded the full sample of tweets using NVivo and Microsoft Excel. For purposes of interrater reliability, the data were then split between the other two researchers (R2 & R3), each coding half of the data (648&647 tweets, respectively). Any discrepancies were then noted. Overall, R1 & R2 had an agreement of 98.0% and R1 & R3 had an agreement of 98.2% across all themes (Îº = .960&. 964, respectively). R1 then reviewed these differences and either changed them (when the differences were attributable to error) or the researchers wrote their rationales for their distinct coding, which was then discussed by the full research team. 4
Results
Direct barriers to formal disclosure of sexual assault included anticipated reactions and outcomes, as well as internalized emotions stemming from direct (n = 44) and indirect (n = 33) experiences. 5 Vicarious experiences were developed by observing others who had formally disclosed a sexual assault. At times, participants described their observations of the formal disclosure process when a close friend was sexually assaulted. Others wrote that their decision not to formally disclose stemmed from their university's reputation for handling sexual assault cases, knowing that they did not want to put themselves in such an ordeal when it was unlikely their institution would do anything about it.
Because I saw what my best friend went through when she reported. Because reporting to my college or the police wouldn't have brought justice. Because reporting would have exacerbated my trauma rather than doing anything to relieve it.
Because when my best friend DID report, she was laughed out of the police station and written off as ""another college slut."" Because I saw why not being believed by the people who can help you did to her. Because I didn't want that for myself.
Because my University's protocol is so notoriously bad that even though I've been through multiple incidents I knew that my school is known for victim blaming, and I am not mentally strong enough to go through that.
Another theme to arise within direct barriers to formal disclosure was internalized emotions, including normalization/minimization of the assault, blame, and shame (n = 120). In some cases, they simply did not know the process to file charges or submit a formal complaint. Internalized shame and self-blame were prevalent within Twitter participants' reasons for not formally reporting or disclosing (n = 613). Shame and self-blame were often compounded with other factors of vulnerability, including queer status, being a person of color, a new student, or believing they already had established a reputation that would work against them.
I was taught rape was a violent attack from a stranger. So in college, when a guy I liked ignored me saying ""no, I'm not ready, please no"" I blamed myself. I became depressed, almost lost my academic scholarship. It would take years before I could even recognize & accept that I'm a rape survivor. We have put the burden on victims for far too long, denying resources & help, absolving ""boys"" for assault by calling it normal behavior. I was in denial about my rape for months afterwards, and by the time I had accepted that that was what it was, my university told me that reporting it would not do anything but make me more stressed and depressed.
It was my first college party & I was ashamed. I didn't have a queer context for survival. My rapist became a big community artist & I was afraid of being shunned for ruining a young QPOC's career by coming out. Told a few people & my suspicions proved true.
It was relatively common for Twitter participants to describe the experiences and social reactions when they did choose to informally or formally disclose(n = 369). Within informal disclosure, a number of participants described negative experiences and how these served as a hindrance to further disclosure (n = 158). While the hashtag was ostensibly intended to describe why individuals chose not to formally report, some used the hashtag as a platform to describe the negative experiences they had when they did report (or attempted to report) to police or formally disclose to other service providers or college employees/administrators (n = 174). Social reactions to both formal and informal disclosures were classified into four categories: normalization/minimization of the assault (n = 50, 26), shame or blame of the discloser (n = 75, n = 54), not believing the discloser or informing the discloser no one else would believe them (n = 46, 26), and discouraging the discloser from further formal or informal disclosure (n = 37, 63). 6  Normalization was a common reaction from college friends who would inform the discloser that this was simply part of the college experience or advise them on how they should be reacting to the assault. Participants were also met with shaming statements from friends and family regarding their attributable role in the assault, which included not fighting back, drinking, or being irresponsible. This was further aggravated when a victim and offender had a current or previous relationship, or if an offender was perceived as someone having high stature.
My story was simple: I was told that you can't be assaulted by a boyfriend. Because I wasn't believed when I tried to tell my college friends what happened because ""I was drunk."" Because I heard ""you can't rape the willing"" from so many people in school He was the student government president and the captain of his sports team and I was a measly little college freshman who was told that he'd never hurt a soul and I didn't know what I was talking about I was roofied and rape",7015,8165

Background: In September 2018, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford accused then-nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. When then-U.S. President Donald Trump questioned her credibility on Twitter, sexual assault survivors began tweeting their reasons for not reporting using the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport. This study examined how these posts were discussed on Twitter and to what extent the tweets fit within levels of the Social Ecological Model (SEM). Method: This study used quantitative content analysis to code 1,000 tweets with #WhyIDidntReport for violence type, reasons for not reporting, and SEM levels. Results: Overall, 68.7% of posts mentioned a specific reason for not reporting; of these, 24.1% referred to the perpetrator being in a position of power, 36.3% feared not being believed, and 20.6% mentioned that others invalidated the assault. In addition, 47.6% mentioned a specific form of violence. Within the SEM, 47.6% referred to individual, 52.6% to relational, 43.2% to community, and 21.7% to societal reasons for not reporting. Conclusion: Reading social media content allows healthcare providers to directly discover how survivors talk about their experiences, priorities in the care environment, and how to support a patient-centered and trauma-informed approach. Implications: Understanding reasons people do not report sexual assault is critical for healthcare professionals to engage patients in open, honest screening and intervention efforts.

unreported (National Sexual Violence Resource Center, 2015). Estimates suggest that one in five women and one in 10 men will experience sexual assault in their lifetime (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2015). Even more alarmingly, only about six of every 1,000 perpetrators are caught or reprimanded (Department of Justice, 2015).
Sequelae of Assault
In addition to the trauma of assault, survivors evince more and more intense physical and mental health problems including chronic pain, depression, persistent fear states, and disturbed sleep (Burton et al., 2013(Burton et al., , 2016;;Csoboth et al., 2005;Humphreys et al., 2011;Humphreys & Lee, 2005). Furthermore, they often attain less success in educational and career pursuits than do their nonabused peers (Adams et al., 2013;Hall, 2000). In addition, betrayal trauma-the experience of being injured or traumatized by someone or something upon which the victim was dependent on for support or survival-can readily compound the experience and may influence a survivor's future relationships with partners and family members (Burton et al., 2019;Martin et al., 2013). Betrayal trauma may proceed as equally from a trusted other who behaved abusively or from an institution or community that failed to respond appropriately or support the survivor (Smidt et al., 2019;Smith & Freyd, 2017). This type of traumatization is particularly common among survivors who were not initially, if ever, believed (Smith & Freyd, 2017).
Social Discourse on Sexual Assault
Despite the prevalence of sexual assault and its clear impact on health, public discourses about sexual assault are often confined to blame assessment, self-defense options for those thought to be at risk, or the mental health of survivors (GarcÃ­a-Moreno et al., 2015). The use of social media to understand how affected individuals view the systems ostensibly designed to aid survivors offers the forensic nursing community an important opportunity to gain a new and different understanding of how to best reach and engage survivors in care. Social media can provide survivors, care providers, and others the opportunity to reclaim narratives around sexual violence and to facilitate support for a public health response to sexual violence (Carlyle, 2017). In fact, #WhyIDidntReport was only one in a series of sexualassault-related hashtags that achieved significant dissemination on and beyond social media. Others, including #WhyIStayed, #NotOkay, and #MeToo, exploded as responses to problematic, often victim-blaming, messages in popular media (Clark, 2016;Guidry et al., 2020;O'Neil et al., 2018;Weathers et al., 2016). To understand the potential impact of these hashtags on sexual assault prevention and treatment, it is necessary to approach them from a public health framework.
Public Health and Sexual Violence Prevention
The CDC (2020) use the Social Ecological Model (SEM) to frame prevention strategies for sexual violence.The SEM depicts the interplay of risk and protective factors across individual, relationship, community, and societal factors, highlighting the need for multilevel approaches to prevention (CDC, 2020). Messages about sexual violence on social media platforms fall within the societal level as they reflect and, at times, shape the social and cultural norms surrounding violence. However, within any given message, risk and protective factors at the other levels may be addressed, thus illustrating mutual influence. For example, alcohol or drug use at the individual level, unsupportive family environment at the relationship level, and lack of support from the police at the community level are all risk factors for sexual violence (CDC, 2020) and potential reasons why a person may not report sexual assault. Carlyle (2017) called for more research investigating conversations about violence on social media and how such discourses may promote a public health approach to prevention by encouraging societal level, rather than individual level, responses. Moreover, examining social media content-because it is user generated-can provide a more robust understanding of the barriers to reporting than traditional approaches. This is because the content is not bound by the same recruitment and participation biases found in laboratory research, which often relies on self-report survey and/or interview. As such, to understand the content and potential impact of #WhyIDidntReport, this study posed the following research questions:
RQ 1: How were #WhyIDidntReport posts discussed on Twitter, and how did users engage (via retweets, likes, and replies) with these posts? RQ 2: To what extent did post content fit within levels of the SEM?
â–ª Method
This study used a quantitative content analysis of 1,000 distinct tweets containing the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport. Tweets were collected via random sampling in September 2018 using the web-based social media mining tool netlytic. org.
Coding Variables
""Twitter engagement variables"" were defined as retweets (sharing another's post with one's own Twitter followers), likes, and replies (direct comment on a tweet). ""Twitterspecific variables"" included the post author's identification (individual, commercial, nonprofit, other), inclusion of visuals, and inclusion of hyperlinks to other sources. ""Reasons for not reporting"" included fear of being blamed, shame, perpetrator in a position of power, feeling threatened, fear of retribution, fear of not being believed, felt it was not important, others having invalidated the assault, did not realize it was abuse, believed they deserved it, felt afraid, believed perpetrator would go free, police/authorities did not take action in the past, police/authorities will not take action, perpetrator was a member of law enforcement, and did not want to relive trauma. ""Violence type variables"" included physical violence, sexual violence, harassment, rape, emotional/psychological aggression, verbal abuse, economic control, stalking, cyberstalking, and reproductive coercion. ""Relationship to perpetrator variables"" included family member, friend of family, friend/acquaintance, stranger, coworker/superior, coach/other leader, teacher/school faculty, (potential) romantic partner, and person in power. ""SEM variables"" included individual, relational, community, and societal reasons for not reporting (see Figures 12345678910111213for reflective exemplars).
Intercoder Reliability
Two coders analyzed tweets. Intercoder reliability was established using 10% (n = 100) of the sample, after which the first coder coded the remainder of the sample. The individual coefficients were all considered to be reliable, with the lowest Krippendorff's alpha coefficient at 0.81.
Statistical Methods
Descriptive analyses were carried out for all variables. Because social media engagement variables are not normally distributed, Mann-Whitney U tests were used to check for differences in Twitter engagement between tweets with and without a number of dichotomous variables. Distributions of the engagement frequencies were evaluated and found to be similar based on visual inspection of a box plot for all variables involved in the Mann-Whitney U tests.
â–ª Results
The primary goal of this study was to examine how #WhyIDidntReport posts were discussed on Twitter. Of the total sample, 68.4% mentioned a specific reason for the victim not reporting; of these, 24.1% referred to the perpetrator being in a position of power (see Figures 1 and2), 36.3% feared they would not be believed (see Figures 3 and4), 20.6% mentioned others invalidated the assault (see Figures 5 and6), 15.4% referred attributions of blame (see Figures 7 and8), and 14.3% mentioned shame as a reason for not reporting (see Figures 9 and10). Figure 11 illustrates the reasons for not reporting.   In addition, 47.6% mentioned a specific form of violence. Of those, 95.6% referred to sexual violence and 40.5% referred to rape (see Figure 12). Reasons for not reporting could be categorized into levels of the SEM in almost three quarters (74.1%) of the tweets. Of those, 47.6% referred to individual, 52.6% to relational, 43.2% to community, and 21.7% to societal reasons (see Figure 13). In addition, 23.8% included a visual, and 13.8% included a hyperlink (see Table 1 for complete descriptive results).
Mann-Whitney U tests were used to determine if tweets with specific variables elicited significantly different engagement among Twitter users than tweets that did not use these variables. Tweets mentioning sexual violence, perpetrator in power, fear of retribution, perpetrator was law enforcement or coach/another type of authority figure, and fear of not being believed were all associated with significantly higher median levels of engagement. Mentioning family, friends, or a romantic partner as perpetrator; mentioning rape, physical violence, or harassment; and/or mentioning self-blame and not recognizing the experience as sexual assault were associated with significantly lower median levels of engagement. Finally, reasons for not reporting at both the relational and community levels of the SEM levels were associated with significantly higher median levels of engagement (see Table 2 for complete results).
â–ª Discussion
Social media platforms have increasingly become a place for individuals to seek support and share both positive and negative personal experiences as well as to influence policies and practices in healthcare, government, and other institutions. Examining the conversations held on such platforms also offers insight into how social media offers opportunities for visibility, support, and activism. In the case of #WhyIDidntReport, survivors of sexual assault engaged in sharing and encouraging dialogues in response to the attack on Dr. Blasey Ford's credibility by then-U.S. President Donald Trump. Discussions tagged with #WhyIDidntReport covered attributions of blame-whether by self or others-reactions of friends and family, and identifying what had happened as abuse or assault as well as its effects on the individual. These tweets were authored by individuals from a wide variety of  backgrounds and intersecting identities. Although authors included public figures such as celebrities, equally present were tweets from individuals who stated that they had never before disclosed their experience. The latter type of post may be of particular interest to forensic nurses and affiliated providers, as these posts can broaden understanding of how survivors decide whether or not to report their experiences with sexual violence.
The results of this study provide a perspective that is unique from previous content analyses of sexual-violencerelated media content. Because many content analyses have focused on the broader context of violence and abuse-within which sexual violence is still often ignored-understanding of public discourses specifically around sexual assault remains underdeveloped. Carlyle et al. (2008) found that 96% of portrayals depicting a form of intimate partner violence (IPV) in their sample of newspaper stories referred to physical violence, with less than 2% mentioning sexual assault. A recent study by Carlyle et al. (2018) on IPV-related posts on the social media platform Pinterest found that, of the pins that portrayed a specific type of IPV, 63.1% portrayed or mentioned physical abuse, whereas 44.7% referenced sexual abuse. In contrast, and perhaps because #WhyIDidntReport was specifically in response to an allegation of sexual assault, the current study found that among tweets mentioning a specific form of violence, 95.6% referred to sexual violence and 40.5% referred specifically to rape, whereas only 7.6% referenced other physical violence.
Another interesting finding is the focus of #WhyIDidntReport on barriers to help-seeking, making the contribution of this study unique among social media investigations of IPV and sexual-violence-related hashtags.  
Original Article
Although #WhyIDidntReport is similar to #WhyIStayed in terms of describing barriers to help-seeking after violence, it is more comparable with #NotOkay and #MeToo in terms of its focus on sexual violence, specifically. Neither of these latter hashtags reflected the same emphasis on obstacles to care or support services, however, which makes this particular study all the more relevant to the work of those providing such services. Identifying and developing remediations to such obstacles is vital to effective public health, policy, and institutional efforts to reduce the incidence and impact of sexual assault across populations.
Finally, the reasons for not reporting were more evenly distributed across levels of the SEM here than in other studies, possibly indicating a more comprehensive assessment of barriers to reporting. This suggests a social discourse that is moving away from individual victim blaming to understanding the full social context impacting these decisions. As Khan et al. (2020) note, this is in contrast to ""rape myths"" that are often otherwise pervasive in social discourses; these include beliefs that many women falsify assault claims, that some behaviors invite assault, that most assaults are perpetrated by strangers, and more. A broader and more contextualized understanding of the influences that discourage reporting thus has the potential to support enhanced and   Original Article more accessible services for survivors. As an example, a recent study of university-affiliated women of color found that these women carefully considered how reporting an experience of sexual assault or IPV would be perceived by their families and communities (Burton & Guidry, 2021). As one of the participants in that study commented, ""[There's] the shame thing, if like you have been touched, like no one's going to want to marry you, like you areâ€¦ my family-or like my culture, they say like you are like rotten fruit at that point, so no one wants to, you know, get rotten fruit"" (Burton & Guidry, 2021, p. 7). For survivors who identify with marginalized populations, the risk of being ostracized may thus force a choice between valued social connections and reporting the assault. In examining the distribution of reasons #WhyIDidntReport across SEM levels, it may thus be possible to develop survivor services that provide needed support across a variety of domains.
â–ª Implications for Practice
Overall, the relatively high level of all types of Twitter engagement (retweets, likes, and replies) with mentions of sexual assault and abuse is suggestive of a robust social discourse on these issues; however, the presence of physical abuse in a tweet was associated with a lower median level of engagement. This suggests that there remains a discursive disconnect between sexual assault and intimate partner or relationship violence, despite the fact that as many as one in three U.S. women report at least one lifetime instance of sexual violence by an intimate partner (National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2018). Clearly, there is need for further dialog and examination of these issues for forensic nurses and other care providers to develop more patient-centered intervention and prevention strategies. As definitions of sexual assault and sexual violence become more encompassing of coercive sexual experiences, intimate partner assaults, and other types of nonconsensual sexual contacts, survivors may be better able to name their experiences as sexual assault and/or IPV, whereas providers may be better able to communicate with patients and clients about those experiences (Bagwell-Gray et al., 2015;Khan et al., 2020).
Of particular interest in the latter is that this study's sample may more accurately reflect a substantive and accurate range of sexual violence experiences and discursive processes because it is public-generated content and not subject to framing by traditional news media or nonprofit support organizations. Our findings show that tweets mentioning rape were associated with lower Twitter engagement in the form of a lower median frequency of likes and replies, which may be because of the ""severity"" of the word and the concept, whereas tweets mentioning powerful perpetrators were more likely to elicit engagement-possibly as a reflection of the precipitating incidents. In cases where the latter is at issue, providers must attend to the safety and privacy of the individual as well as to the experience: Reporting could create fractious situations with the family and community, especially where social supports may be tied to one or both.
The results of this study generally have important implications not only for the care of sexual assault survivors but also for universal implementation of trauma-informed care strategies. Forensic nurses and other healthcare providers should be aware of public discourse on sexual violence as it provides valuable insights into patient perspectives. Of particular importance were the tweets where the writers described not recognizing that the experience was in fact abuse or assault. As one user in this sample noted, ""It took me a decade of denial to realize what it was."" Although this user specifically references denial, others pointed out that they were told it was normal, to be expected, or that a romantic partner could not be guilty of assault. These reflect the influence of the ""rape myth"" discourses described above. Providers must therefore be cognizant that some survivors neither identify as such, nor do they identify their experiences as assault. As such, simply asking a patient  about history of sexual violence or assault is not likely to yield accurate responses. Careful history taking is vital. The provider must not create a shaming or traumatizing situation by forcing the patient to identify the experience as sexual assault, as identifying as a survivor may bring with it reflections on social identity and self-concept that the patient is not ready or able to integrate. Even if the patient identifies as a survivor, studies suggest that they may not readily share that information with a provider (Burton & Carlyle, 2015). Although forensic nurses are usually aware of their patient's most immediate trauma, other providers may not routinely include screening for histories of sexual assault (Burton et al., 2019). This may lead to overlooked risk factors as well as missed opportunities to mitigate any of the myriad health conditions resulting from sexual assault. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, sexual assault disclosures should prompt healthcare providers to acknowledge the considerable strength and resilience of survivors and their potential for healing (Harvey, 2007).
Limitations
One limitation of this study is possible selection bias of the people who choose to tweet #WhyIDidntReport. Those willing to use the hashtag could be more comfortable discussing the topic and/or have already sought support such that they were less traumatized by recalling their experiences. In addition, it is unclear whether the respondents in this study used Twitter frequently or infrequently, further limiting the generalizability of the sample and the results. Finally, U.S. Twitter users tend to be younger; 38% of U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 29 years and 26% of U.S. adults between 30 and 49 years old use the platform versus 17% of adults between 50 and 64 years old and only 7% of those over 64 years old (Perrin & Anderson, 2019). Future studies should consider focusing on other social media platforms as well as on older populations. 
â–ª Conclusions
Health professionals need to be aware of social media platforms and consider using them to learn about and engage with survivors. Understanding the language used by survivors to share their stories and give voice for their experiences is imperative for working with them in an appropriately supportive manner. Developing a therapeutic relationship with a patient requires trust, patience, and understanding-all of which may be compromised in the context of trauma-and the lack of a shared language can lead to retraumatization (Cleary & Hungerford, 2015). Reading social media content allows providers to passively discover how survivors talk about their lived experiences, their priorities in the care environment, and how to help ensure a patient-centered and trauma-informed approach. Moreover, understanding the reasons why people do not report sexual assault is of vital importance for healthcare professionals aiming to engage patients in open, honest screening and intervening conversations.",4095,4663
10.1177/0896920518778107,,,False,Carol Harrington,"Neo-liberal Subjectivity, Self-branding and â€˜My Rape Storyâ€™ YouTube Videos","
This article considers the YouTube 'My Rape Story' genre in light of critical feminist analyses of rape survivor stories. The feminist mobilization that developed out of the political ferment of 1968 told a 'rape story' of male power and women's oppression. However, as first-hand rape stories proliferated in late 20th-century popular media, psychological experts typically framed them with therapeutic narratives of individual self-efficacy and self-transformation. Critical feminist analyses of such rape 'survivor discourse' called for new discursive spaces that would allow survivors to eschew therapeutic accounts. A new generation of women have spoken out on a variety of digital platforms, confronting established limits on talking about rape. Considering YouTube 'My Rape Story' videos as one manifestation of this new wave of speaking out, my analysis shows that examples of such videos evidence the impact of incitements to self-disclosure through selfbranding built into much social media. I argue that these videos exemplify how first-hand rape stories can provide a site for the construction of neo-liberal subjectivity by positioning rape trauma as something survivors must work on in order to achieve self-efficacy. Nevertheless, these accounts also show resistance to victim-blaming rape myths.
",2018-05-23,Critical Sociology,SAGE Publications,"Introduction
Publicly told first-hand stories of sexual violence have proliferated in the context of a more general trend for personal disclosures on public digital platforms (Misoch, 2015). Rape survivors have told their stories on a variety of digital platforms both in writing and on video. This article considers the YouTube genre 'my rape story' as a window on common understandings of rape. I analyse these stories as accounts: narratives that seek to explain unusual or distressing happenings by assigning reasons, responsibility and meaning to events, actors and outcomes (Davis, 2005: 152;Orbuch, 1997: 455). Accounts help define situations and convey messages about proper and improper conduct, emotional responses, causality, and desirable outcomes. By analysing YouTube accounts of rape we can gain some insight into everyday ways of understanding the causes, consequences and meanings of sexual violence for social media users.
Much of the feminist literature that considers online stories of sexual violence has focused optimistically on a new generation of feminist political activism, for example how the 'feminist blogosphere' and feminist use of platforms such as Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook have popularized the concept of 'rape culture' (Keller et al., 2018). According to Carrie Rentschler, digital media have allowed young feminists to create spaces to discuss sexual violence and harassment that combine 'testimonial, advice giving, and cultures of support' (Rentschler, 2014: 68). Both Rentschler and Anastacia Powell discuss the widely reported Steubenville, Ohio case in which a blogger compiled screen shots of social media posts by two high school football players boasting about an assault on an unconscious young woman at a party (Powell, 2015;Rentschler, 2014). The subsequent publicity contributed to criminal charges brought in a case that authorities had originally seemed reluctant to pursue (Rentschler, 2014: 65). Powell (2015: 11) argues that this and other cases where survivors have named perpetrators online shows how digital media can provide victims with a way to seek 'rape justice,' defined as affording victims 'participation, voice, validation and vindication' in the face of a criminal justice system that has largely failed sexual violence victims.
This article extends such literature by considering the YouTube 'My Rape Story' genre. I build on Linda Alcoff and Laura Gray's (1993: 275) argument that not all forms of speaking out about sexual violence challenge 'dominant patriarchal discourses' and that we should interrogate incitements to speak out. When considering this new wave of speaking out about sexual violence and harassment on digital media platforms I suggest that we should be mindful of how social media incites self-branding through self-disclosure. The article begins by considering feminist practices of speaking out about sexual violence and their spread to popular culture. I then discuss practices of speaking out about sexual violence on social media as part of a broader Web 2.0 trend of selfbranding through self-disclosure. Following this, I introduce the YouTube 'my rape story' genre. My analysis shows how social media incitements to self-brand through self-disclosure shape the sorts of rape stories told on YouTube. These accounts exemplify how speaking out about sexual violence can serve in the construction of a neo-liberal subjectivity for women. Nevertheless, they also evidence resistance to misogynistic victim-blaming discourse.
The politics of sexual violence stories
While past generations of activists have politicized sexual violence, for example in the anti-slavery, anti-trafficking and US civil rights movements, the women's liberation movement of the 1970s gave more frank first-hand accounts than their predecessors and put great emphasis on 'speaking out' about sexual violence as a political act (Harrington, 2010;McGuire, 2007). The political strategy of 'speaking out' about sexual violence emerged from US feminist practices of 'consciousness raising' whereby groups of women met to analyse commonalities in their personal lives and formulate political responses. According to Carol Hanisch (2010), author of the seminal article 'the personal is political,' organizers envisaged that shared analysis of personal experience would inform the elaboration of feminist theory as the knowledge base for a mass women's movement, while consciousness-raising groups would also provide a 'broad, grassroots base' for such a mass movement (Hanisch, 2010).
The feminist mobilization that developed in the United States following the political ferment of 1968 told a 'rape story' of male power and women's oppression (Plummer, 1995). US feminist theorists drew on women's sexual violence stories to politicize sexual violence as embedded in everyday power relations of gender, race and class. For example Susan Brownmiller (1975) drew on anonymized testimonies from feminist 'speak outs' on sexual violence for her seminal history of rape. She theorized rape as a 'conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear' and defined all rape as a political crime because it sustained women's social oppression (Brownmiller, 1975: 15, 211). Diana Russell's (2003) The Politics of Rape, also first published in 1975, presented stories from anonymous interviews with rape survivors, theorizing that rape should be understood as an expression of normative masculinity rather than as deviant. Also in 1975, Angela Davis (2002) reflected on the case of Joan Little, a Black woman on trial for murdering a prison guard who raped her. Davis (2002) complicated the story of male power and women's oppression, writing that 'rape is not one-dimensional and homogenous-but one feature that does remain constant is the overt and flagrant treatment of women, through rape, as property. Particular rape cases will then express different modes in which women are handled as property.' In the US context she observed that rape functions as 'a means of terrorizing the entire black community' (Davis, 2002). In the United States and internationally later generations of feminist scholars and activists both critiqued and built upon such observations (e.g. Galbraith, 2000;Gavey, 2005;Moorti, 2002;Phipps, 2009).
While publicly telling a personal story of sexual violence may have been a radical act in the early 1970s, by the 1980s such stories were ubiquitous in popular culture (Davis, 2005: 27). For example, first-hand sexual violence stories have become a staple of talk shows. However, as Alcoff and Gray (1993) argue, the effect of such shows usually undermines the transgressive potential of 'speaking out' about sexual violence. Talk shows typically focus on the tearful face of the survivor as she gives her account before turning to psychological experts to interpret it (Alcoff and Gray, 1993: 277). Such speaking arrangements 'recuperate dominant patriarchal discourses' by sensationalizing the survivor's story for public consumption and framing it in terms of rape myths, for example scrutinizing the survivor's conduct and positioning her as in need of expert psychological help (Alcoff and Gray, 1993: 275).
By the 1990s pioneers of feminist anti-sexual violence activism argued that, in the words of Kiss Daddy Goodnight author Louise Armstrong (1994), the problem of sexual violence had 'been coopted and re-formulated by the therapeutic ideology, â€¦ [as] not social, but medical. The response is not a call for change, but a call for ""treatment"". ' Armstrong (1994) notes that psychological professionals have gained recognition as experts with authority to speak about sexual violence. Davis' (2005: 165-215) analysis of 19 influential therapeutic manuals on treatment of child sex-abuse victims shows how experts agree that recovery requires victims to produce an account of their abuse that assigns responsibility to the perpetrator and to narrate their recovery as a 'survivor' and then a 'thriver.' Therapeutic advice to adult victims follows the same model, based on a conception of sexual violence as a cause of post-traumatic stress disorder (Harrington, 2010: 115). Such therapeutic models assume that victims need expert intervention in order to transform into 'thrivers.' Therapeutic accounts of sexual violence focus upon a guided narration of self-transformation in keeping with Michel Foucault's (1979: 58-73) definition of confessional speech. In confessional speech the speaker tells a story about the self to another who may or may not be present and who is imagined as judging the story. Indeed, confessions may be made in relation to authoritative social norms rather than to a specific person (Fejes, 2011: 807). The goal of confession is to work upon the self through examining and narrating the self. Andreas Fejes and Magnus Dahlstedt (2013: 2) argue that contemporary confessional practices operate within a therapeutic logic that constructs subjects as needing 'support to handle their emotions.' Such a therapeutic logic links social problems to emotional problems and makes a virtue of emotional self-disclosure (Fejes and Dahlstedt, 2013: 5).
Trauma and suffering have a prominent place in neo-liberal stories of self-transformation. Lauren Berlant (2001: 42) argues that since the late 20th century 'proximity to trauma' has become a ubiquitous trope in narratives of self-transformation. She argues that this testimonial genre whereby victims tell a story of trauma, suffering and recovery is bound up with governmental modalities of 'cleaning up subjects and the social that mark a certain modern faith in the intentional self and its visible effects' (Berlant, 2001: 49). Therapeutic treatment for trauma calls for selfscrutiny to uncover and transform aspects of habits and functioning affected by the trauma, for example addictions, sleeping patterns, sexual conduct and employment prospects (Davis, 2005;Harrington, 2005Harrington, , 2010: 117): 117). Rape, sexual violence and harassment have gained significant recognition as questions of trauma within neo-liberal political discourse (Harrington, 2010). Stories of rape trauma and recovery can provide terrain for the construction of resilient neo-liberal subjects who 'take back control' of their lives.
Policy attention to sexual violence against women and girls has formed part of a broader neoliberal interest in gender equity policies since the late 20th century. Following World War Two, many welfare states supported male breadwinner/female homemaker families to varying degrees. States would even pay a meagre income to mothers in the absence of a male breadwinner without the 'work requirements' common today (Lewis, 2001). However, following the late 20th-century neo-liberal turn, 'activation' polices have aimed to draw women, mothers in particular, into paid work. The OECD and development organizations represent maternal income as a solution to poverty (Eisenstein, 2017). Many states now promote the dual earner family model as best suited to weather the insecure, 'flexible' employment markets favoured by free-market champions (Daly, 2011). Meanwhile, discourse on corporate responsibility puts forth a 'business case' for promoting gender equality as a profitable investment (Calkin, 2017).
In the context of neo-liberal efforts to engage women with income generation, treatment for sexual violence trauma can provide a site for the construction of economically self-reliant, resilient female subjects. In both a domestic and international development context, programmes for victims of sexual and gender-based violence typically fit broader governmental agendas to produce such neo-liberal female subjects by problematizing victims' trauma rather than gendered social patterns that foster sexual violence. Research on programmes to assist victims of trafficking for prostitution in South-Eastern Europe, for example, shows how psychological assessments represented women's decisions to migrate and do sex work as evidence of disordered thinking attributable to trauma rather than their economic circumstances (Brunovskis and Surtees, 2008;Harrington, 2005). In British Columbia, Canada, the 'Bridges' programme for battered women offered counselling and other forms of support embedded in a programme that aimed to 'persuade battered women to ""reframe their life views and predicaments, and to appreciate that they have choices and that they must accept responsibility for their lives rather than blaming others""' (Silverstein and Spark, 2007: 332). In the absence of adequate support and opportunities, such programmes downplay social factors and construct women as able to change their circumstances through reframing how they narrate their lives. Thus in the case of speaking out about rape, as Sara Ahmed and Jackie Stacy (Ahmed and Stacey, 2001: 4) note: 'the desire to tell one's own story can easily support particular neo-liberal or even conservative agendas based on a heroic construction of the individual and of the individuated self.'
Acknowledging the dangers of the confessional speech for anti-sexual violence politics, Alcoff and Gray (1993: 287) argue that 'what we need to do is not retreat -as Foucault might suggestfrom bringing sexual violence into discourse but, rather, to create new discursive forms and spaces in which to gain autonomy within this process.' They give the example of lists naming rapists that appeared on Brown College's bathroom walls in 1990. They argue that 'the bathroom list represents an interesting and innovative attempt to make survivor discourse public in such a way as to minimize the dangers of speaking out for survivors yet maximize the disruptive potential of survivor outrage' (Alcoff and Gray, 1993: 286). According to Alcoff and Gray (1993: 287) the anonymity and seclusion of the bathroom allowed the list makers to achieve autonomy within the conditions of their discourse by creating their own discursive space to challenge authorities who refused to acknowledge their claims of sexual violence or punish the perpetrators. They suggest that rather than celebrate all forms of 'speaking out' about sexual violence we need to pay attention to who incites stories of sexual violence and the role of experts in reinterpreting such stories (Alcoff and Gray, 1993). Building on Alcoff and Gray's arguments, Nancy Naples (2003) argues that survivor support networks have the capacity to produce their own political analyses of sexual abuse when they consciously eschew the limits of therapeutic accounts and take an intersectional approach that is mindful of the material conditions shaping experience and speech.
Digital media, self-disclosure and opposition to rape culture
Arguably, digital media provide survivors with the capacity to carve out more accessible discursive spaces than campus bathroom walls. Scholars have documented how digital platforms have enabled feminists to respond to instances of sexual violence and harassment by forming networks of support based on opposition to sexual violence (Keller et al., 2018;Rentschler, 2014;Sills et al., 2016). Rentschler (2014: 66) treats young feminists' 'production of testimonials about rape culture via social media as an activist media practice that extends beyond the representation of rape culture to constitute a capacity to respond to the cultural supports for sexual violence.' Such responses go beyond inward-looking therapeutic support networks, for example Hollaback! encourages women and LBGTQI people to share their stories of street sexual harassment via the Hollaback! website and apps that allow for local mapping of street harassment. They also provide guides for organizing local meetings to combat street harassment in specific geographic communities (Hollaback, 2016). Powell (2015) discusses cases where victims and activists have used social media to name perpetrators of sexual violence. Thus, digital media have sustained anti-sexual violence networks that not only avoid subjecting survivors to expert therapeutic scrutiny but also drive community level change and the search for justice.
Digital platforms allow multiple survivor accounts to proliferate without expert therapeutic interpretation or sensational voyeuristic framing by talk show hosts. Furthermore, such platforms allow for tagging to link endless individual accounts, a feature with great potential to reveal social patterns. Projects such as the Tumblr site 'Project Unbreakable' link isolated individual moments into a clear pattern. 'Project Unbreakable,' founded by photographer Grace Brown, displays photographs of survivors holding up cards with a quotation from their rapist or from someone they told about their rape, for example: 'don't be such a little tease'; or 'you really shouldn't have slept in the room with him' (Project Unbreakable, 2014, 2015). The repeated themes in the quotations link individual stories, thus constructing a critical commentary on common minimizations and rationalizations of sexual violence. Twitter hashtags have similar potential to amplify critical commentary, for example #whatwereyouwearing invited survivors to describe their clothing when they were raped. Famously, #metoo asked people to simply identify that they had experienced sexual harassment or violence.
This article focuses upon the YouTube 'my rape story' genre. These videos allow for fuller narration than tweets. In 'my story' videos people narrate something remarkable, funny or dramatic that happened to them. Some of YouTube's 'my story-tellers' regularly post personal stories to their channel alongside other videos where they may promote fashion or lifestyle advice, review products and urge viewers to 'like, comment and subscribe.' Thus the proliferation of YouTube 'my rape story' videos should be understood as part of a broader trend in which people mobilize their personal stories to build an online persona and cultivate a following. Self-disclosure is built into the logic of much digital social media that requires users to construct an online profile using photographs, videos, information and stories about themselves. People disclose mundane and major events from their everyday lives publicly through digital platforms, posting pictures of their meals, commentary on their moods, or video of themselves proposing marriage or taking a pregnancy test (Talvitie-Lamberg, 2014).
The rise of digital social media, often called Web 2.0, has facilitated and normalized self-branding. As Alison Hearn puts it, 'these sites produce inventories of branded selves' (Hearn, 2008: 211). Self-branding practices draw on therapeutic and self-help discourse that inform efforts to discover an authentic self that can be presented others in a sympathetic way (Lair et al., 2005: 308). Selfbranding thus demands self-disclosure to communicate 'who I am' to the target audience in a manner that will elicit the desired sense of emotional connection (Banet-Weiser, 2012: 81). Promoters of self-branding present it as a strategy for an uncertain economy where people must be constantly prepared to market themselves (Lair et al., 2005: 315-318). Indeed, the Northern Californian 'technology scene' occupied by the professionals who designed significant Web 2.0 platforms requires them to market their 'self-consciously constructed personae â€¦ like brands or celebrities, to an audience or fan base' so as to advance their status in that milieu (Marwick, 2010: 5). Therefore, these professionals built self-branding practices into the design of social media applications, reflecting 'the values of a network dominated by commercial interest' (Marwick, 2010: 5).
Social media thus includes an incitement to self-disclosure and self-branding that may explain the sorts of rape stories people tell on YouTube. YouTube 'my rape story' video creators may not intentionally set out to self-brand; however, the logic of YouTube's incitement to 'broadcast yourself' invites strategic self-disclosure in the service of building an online personae (Banet-Weiser, 2012: 57). In what follows, I discuss some examples of 'my rape story' YouTube videos created by women and girls. Men, boys and non-binary identifying people also post 'my rape story' videos worthy of analysis. However, since gender structures the sorts of rape stories people tell, here I confine myself to videos whose creators present as women/girls. Following Alcoff and Gray (1993), I ask what incitements to speak seem apparent in these videos, and what sort of accounts they give.
Accounts of sexual violence in 'my rape story' videos
I searched YouTube for 'my rape story' videos that presented as a narrative of personal experience by the person who posted the video. Different search terms would have returned different results, but here I discuss 'my rape story' videos as a particular genre. I excluded the parodies, Ted talks, and apparently fictional accounts that searches for 'my rape story' also returned. I began my analysis with a good preliminary 'soak' in the data, watching numerous YouTube 'my rape story' videos to gain a general sense of their typical structure and themes (Hall, 1975: 15). To develop a qualitative analysis of a range of videos I filtered by 'most viewed' and upload date. 'Most viewed' videos tended to be by commercial 'YouTubers,' as they call themselves, with large followings and hundreds of thousands of views. Filtering by upload date allowed me to view videos with much lower viewer numbers, some by people who appeared to have commercial aspirations for their channel and some not. I selected videos by diverse creators in terms of apparent race and ethnicity but only watched videos in English.
I captured 56 videos by 48 individual creators (five made more than one rape-story video) in NVivo and wrote an analytical description of the accounts of rape they offered. I also analysed the YouTube channels and linked social media of the video creators to get a sense of how their rape story video fit within their broader social media activity. After several months I noticed that eight videos had been removed, suggesting the video creators may have regretted their post. Thus, my final collection included 48 videos by 40 individual creators. Ethical dilemmas arise from citing videos that have been removed and, indeed, any video of first-hand disclosures of sexual violence. People who post their rape stories on YouTube may not anticipate becoming subject to critical academic analysis (Morrow et al., 2015: 537). Thus, in the following discussion I do not provide direct citations to the videos but use pseudonyms and anonymize examples.
'My rape story' videos usually employ one of two formats: cue cards or speaking to the camera. In both types the creators mostly show their face and film themselves in their home environment, often a messy bedroom. Scholars have noted that the 'DIY' aesthetic of apparently non-professional YouTube videos made at home with a simple digital camera lends them an 'authenticity effect' (Tolson, 2010: 286). In the case of the 'my rape story' genre this effect bolsters the truth claims made by the video-creator. In cue card videos the creator films themselves holding a series of handwritten messages. Their story unfolds a few words at a time with each card removed to reveal the one beneath. Often a musical soundtrack contributes to the narrative mood. In her analysis of the cue card genre, Kimberley Hall (2016) argues that this gradual unfolding of the cards and use of handwriting creates the sense of a glimpse into someone else's inner life by aesthetically invoking diary and letter writing. The video creators who tell their story by speaking directly to the camera achieve a similar effect by appearing to confide a personal story in the viewer. Whether deploying handwriting or not, such videos exemplify a form of self-writing whereby video creators seek to align 'the gaze of the other and that gaze which one aims at oneself' regarding their story (Foucault, 1997: 221;Hall, 2016: 6).
These accounts explain what happened before, during and after the rape. The story-teller describes events leading up to the rape, and her relationship with the perpetrator. More than half told of rape by someone they had previously cared about: a boyfriend or close male friend. Around quarter told of rape on a first date or by someone they had recently met; only two told of a stranger rape. Another quarter told of rape by an older family member or family friend when they were young. Some describe their rape in detail; others simply say 'he raped me.' 'Rape' in these stories referred to vaginal, anal and oral penetration by a penis and vaginal penetration by fingers. Most story-tellers narrate their changing reaction to their rape over time. Before considering these accounts in more detail, I will describe the sorts of YouTube channels they appeared on and how some creators deployed them to self-brand.
YouTubers and personal sharing
The majority of 'My Rape Story' video creators maintained YouTube channels where they promoted themselves, encouraging viewers to 'click, comment, subscribe.' Only nine of the 40 video creators appeared uninterested in promoting products or themselves as YouTubers. Three of these posted under a pseudonym, hid their face and used cue cards. The other six posted few videos; those they did post appeared designed for friends rather than accumulating views and subscribers. The remaining 31 creators mostly posted videos on topics popular with female YouTubers, for example make-up tutorials, 'mall-haul' and 'what's in my bag?' While some videoed themselves singing or acting, their videos mostly concerned feminine topics such as fashion, shopping, relationships and mothering.
Thus these creators evidence what Brook Duffy and Emily Hund (2015: 1) describe as 'a proliferation of socially mediated cultures of creative production located in the traditionally feminine domains of fashion, beauty, parenting, and craft.' They understand these 'modes of creative selfenterprise' as a symptom of post-Fordist labour, characterized by unstable, casual and contractbased employment (Duffy and Hund, 2015: 1). Ideals of entrepreneurialism, self-reliance and work as a passion flourish in such conditions and aspiring creative workers are advised to develop an 'authentic' self-brand (Duffy and Hund, 2015: 2). Duffy and Hund's (2015: 7) research about female fashion bloggers argued that they deployed 'carefully curated personal sharing' as a way of appearing 'authentic,' for example by posting about family birthdays.
For both established and aspiring You Tubers, posting their rape story can function as such 'carefully curated personal sharing.' Seventeen of the 40 creators studied here had clearly commercial aspirations. They provided a business address, endorsed products and promoted their books or art. Some embedded self-promotion and product promotion within their rape story videos. For example, Esther begins by promoting one of her other videos before telling her audience that today they will hear a story she does not usually tell; she asks them to share it so that her channel can grow. She concludes by reminding viewers that she posts new videos every day. Her channel provides a link to her beauty website that promotes various products. Many of Esther's videos review cosmetics while others tell stories in her signature vivacious style. In another example, Amber ends her rape story on a cliff-hanger, telling viewers they should buy her book to read what happened next and her steps for recovery.
Fourteen less clearly commercial video creators apparently aspired to become YouTube personalities. Their channels looked similar to those of commercial YouTubers, with story-times, makeup tutorials, pet-names for the audience and calls to 'click, comment, subscribe.' Some post regularly and usually gain a few hundred views. Others apparently lost interest after posting only a few videos. In one case, Alyssa's first video introduced her channel as focused on diet, fitness and self-empowerment but her three subsequent videos concerned her rape; she no longer posts. In another, Peaches posted just 10 videos on popular YouTuber topics such as 'back to school haul' as well as her rape story.
Rape story videos attracted many views. None of Peaches' videos got more than 10 views except her rape story that got over 350. An aspiring pop singer's videos usually gained two hundred or so views whereas her rape story video received more than six thousand. After Destiny's video earned more than three-hundred thousand views she made a follow-up video expressing excitement at her suddenly increased viewership and asking for feedback on other topics she should cover. The success of such videos may incite YouTubers to tell their stories.
Arguably, YouTube has turned sexual violence stories into a commodity that creators may use to self-brand and emotionally connect with a following. A rape story may contribute to diverse personal brands by fostering particular kinds of emotional connection. For example, Destiny used YouTube to market herself as a weight-loss and lifestyle coach. Her rape story video contributes to her personal brand based in self-transformation. One of the few creators who did not cry while telling her story, her account emphasizes the strength and wisdom she gained from the experience. She says she wants to share her story so her followers can know her better and learn from her experience. Thus, she positions herself as a mentor, even calling herself a 'guru.' Her channel links to her website where she sells her self-published book and describes her 'weight-loss journey.' Her videos concern weight-loss and more general advice about positive thinking and self-branding for success in life.
Emogirl's first YouTube video told of her rape with cue cards. Pale with heavy black eyeliner, in her 24 subsequent videos she speaks to the camera of surviving indifferent parents, bullying at school and suicide attempts. She addresses her viewers affectionately, saying that their support helps her. Emogirl won thousands of subscribers and views. Her final video says 'my life is on Instagram now' and encourages people to follow her there, where she posts her art. Emogirl's personal brand on YouTube emotionally engaged followers with her feelings of worthlessness and her resilience; her silent cue card rape story lay at the heart of this emotional experience.
Krystal presents as bubbly and conventionally feminine, she films herself in full make-up and revealing clothing alongside accoutrements of femininity such as cosmetics. Her videos tell both light-hearted and serious personal stories; her channel promotes her self-published autobiographical book. An expressive and engaging story-teller, Krystal made two videos about her rape as a teenager and a third about a separate sexual assault. In the third video she mentions that she had already told the story on her Patreon channel soon after the incident because she feels most comfortable sharing intimate stories there, seamlessly weaving a marketing pitch into sharing her story. On Patreon followers can subscribe to exclusive content for a monthly fee; Krystal implies this fee also buys a higher level of intimacy. She cries while telling her story and thanks her viewers for her feeling of 'a weight off her chest,' positioning them as intimate friends in whom she confides and who nurture her.
By introducing their rape story as a rarely talked about secret, YouTubers can further the sense of emotional engagement on which their channels depend. Thus in the blurb for her first rape story video Krystal says, 'I have always been open and transparent with you guys.' Destiny says she feels a responsibility to share her story with her followers as part of her mission to 'help people be a better them.' Esther says she does not usually tell people about her rape story but, 'this channel is for you to know me better.' Penny introduces her video as an 'honest heart-to-heart' with her viewers. All express affection for their viewers, usually by saying 'I love you guys' sometimes blowing kisses to the camera.
Few of these You Tubers evidenced any interest in feminism. Krystal used the feminist #metoo when it was trending; Bonnie tweeted support for the women's march; Toni vlogs about social justice issues, feminism, fat politics and 'random stuff'; Keira speaks of her anger at US college athlete Brock Turner's light rape sentence. However, most told stories of rape as a personal trauma without explicit reference to feminist politics.
'My rape story' accounts: Causes and responsibility

10.1080/14680777.2018.1546215,,,False,Carol Harrington,"Popular feminist websites, intimate publics, and feminist knowledge about sexual violence","
This article presents a qualitative analysis of conversations about rape in the comments sections of two popular feminist websites: Jezebel and xoJane. Focussing on comment threads about first-hand experiences of sexual violence and problematic heterosex, I show that commenters produced an analysis of rape as on a continuum with less extreme forms of sexual coercion, as heterogeneous and as a predictable product of heterosexual norms. I argue that the intimate publics fostered by popular feminist websites enable such conversations to take place. Intimate publics presuppose consumers who share an emotional literacy based in similar life experiences: commenters assumed fellow consumers of popular feminist media possessed the emotional literacy to comprehend rape stories which did not follow the hegemonic rape script. Thus, popular feminist intimate publics may provide a forum for conversations about sexual violence which resemble feminist consciousness-raising as a mode of knowledge production. However, misogynists may seek out such conversations to engage participants in debate. Thus, digital commenting platforms which facilitate the exclusion of disruptive or abusive commenters provide essential context for feminist intimate publics to flourish. Participants also contribute to the construction of feminist intimate publics by communicating empathy and affect, and by policing trolls.
",2018-11-26,Feminist Media Studies,Informa UK Limited,"Introduction
Digital media have provided opportunities for sexual violence survivors to publicly share their stories and participate in online conversations about their experiences. This article analyses the nuanced interpretations of sexual violence, consent, and sex evident in some examples of such digital discussions on popular feminist websites. I argue that such websites may construct feminist intimate publics which foster personal disclosure, empathy, and identification among participants. Such feminist intimate publics provide a forum for conversations about sexual violence which resemble feminist consciousnessraising as a mode for the production and dissemination of knowledge.
A limited scholarly literature to date has focused upon how digital media have nurtured feminist activism against sexual violence, particularly among young women (Jessalynn Keller, Kaitlynn Mendes, and Jessica Ringrose 2018;Anastasia Powell 2015;Carrie A. Rentschler 2014). Scholars have also pondered the extent to which social media provide an alternative way for survivors to seek informal ""rape justice"" in the face of a criminal justice system which fails to meet their needs (Hadar Dancig-Rosenberg and Anat Peleg 2017; Powell 2015). Rachel Loney-Howes (2018) argues that websites which host a variety of rape survivor stories help to challenge a hegemonic ""rape script"" of innocent victims and monstrous perpetrators which misrecognizes as sex those rapes which do not conform to this script. For example, stories where a woman continues her relationship with a partner who had raped her challenge common assumptions about how victims feel after a sexual attack (Loney-Howes 2018).
Building on such literature, this article shows how popular feminist websites have fostered conversations about first-hand narratives of sexual violence which contest heterosexual norms of female acquiescence to unwanted sex. I offer a qualitative analysis of how conversations about rape developed on two popular feminist websites: Jezebel and xoJane. I consider the analyses of sexual violence and heterosexual norms evident in these conversations and ask how participants created a digital space where such conversations could unfold. The article begins by considering critical analyses of popular feminism and locating Jezebel and xoJane as manifestations of commercialized popular feminism. I draw attention to the sense of community expressed by commenters on these publications, introducing the concept of intimate publics to theorize how commercial publications may foster community feeling. I then turn to literature on possibilities for feminist consciousness-raising through digital media and highlight the distinctive features of this mode of knowledge generation. Following this, I analyse discussions about first-hand stories of sexual violence on xoJane and Jezebel as instances of the construction and dissemination of feminist knowledge about sexual violence. I consider mechanisms that enable such feminist conversations to occur on a public digital platform despite the anti-feminism and misogyny common on the Internet. I conclude that regardless of their shortcomings, popular feminist media may foster intimate publics which nurture participants' engagement in feminist knowledge production. Participants in such publics contribute to their maintenance by policing trolls and by communicating empathy and affect.
Popular feminism and intimate publics
Scholars have noted a new feminist ""luminosity"" which began around 2012, a period of ""cool"" feminism where a feminist identity provides a certain cultural capital (Sara Farris and Catherine Rottenberg 2017;Rosalind Gill 2016). Some have pointed to BeyoncÃ©'s 2014 performance before the giant, glowing word ""feminist"" as confirmation that ""feminism is having a moment, and an unprecedented one"" in popular culture (Sarah Banet-Weiser and Laura Portwood-Stacer 2017, 885). In this moment, various individuals and corporations have integrated feminism into their brand (Emma Tennent and Sue Jackson 2017;Andi Zeisler 2016). This ""popular feminism"" acknowledges gender inequality and ""the vulnerability of women in a sexist context,"" but for the most part highlights individualistic rather than structural or systematic solutions (Sarah Banet-Weiser 2018, 154;Gill 2016, 615-616).
Popular feminism thus bears inflections of what Angela McRobbie (2011) analysed as post-feminism, a neo-liberal positioning of certain confident women as men's equals in employment and consumption. However, a post-feminist sensibility repudiates feminism as irrelevant to a new generation whereas popular feminism celebrates women's ongoing struggle against gender inequality. Popular feminism invokes female solidarity around shared experiences of sexism while celebrating female self-confidence and resilience in the face of sexism. Yet Gill (2016) demonstrates that even media which celebrate feminism evidence a post-feminist sensibility by conflating it with individual female assertiveness, defiance, and achievement. Representations of feminism mingle revolutionary symbols with emblems of traditional female beauty; for example, the radical feminist clenched fist rendered in pink with long polished fingernails (Gill 2016, 623). Thus, Gill concludes that much popular feminism sits comfortably with neo-liberal capitalism.
I researched popular feminist media which evidence many such problematic features. I focused upon Jezebel and xoJane because of their commercial success and content which blends traditional women's media interest in fashion and beauty with a defiant feminist pose. Furthermore, both websites maintain an active comments section while some feminist media avoid the perils of inviting comments. Thus, analysis of these websites allows for exploration of popular feminist media's potential to foster feminist conversations despite their post-feminist sensibility and commercial aspirations.
Jezebel, launched in 2007, publishes on pop culture, fashion, sex, media, and politics. Stories cover celebrities and products which make feminism part of their brand, sexual violence, and other feminist issues. Jezebel's distinctive voice expresses a feminist sensibility through humour, informality, provocation, and ""snark."" Founding editor Anna Holmes reports that Gawker media's editorial team initially warned her against giving their new women's site a feminist voice, but she ignored them (Jordan Michael Smith 2017). Arguably, Jezebel broke new ground by demonstrating that feministinfluenced websites aimed at women could be commercially successful (Smith 2017). Founding features editor Moe Tkacik (quoted in Smith 2017) commented: ""I really despise mainstream feminism [but] Jezebel was part of bringing feminism into the mainstream.""
Similar sites followed, including xoJane in 2011. According to a call for submissions, xoJane was ""written by a group of women (and some token males) with strong voices, identities and opinions, many in direct opposition to each other, who are living what they are writing about"" (About xoJane). The site gained notoriety for publishing confessional ""it happened to me"" essays, some of which went viral, with other websites and mainstream media republishing and discussing them (Mandy Valid critiques can be made of Jezebel's and xoJane's feminist branding and postfeminist sensibility. Janice Loreck's (2018, 272) analysis of Jezebel's ""Photoshop of Horrors"" feature, which highlights mainstream media Photoshopping of women's images, concludes that ""a feminist reading persona does not necessarily further women's culture equality."" She criticizes the feature's apparent aim of embarrassing certain female celebrities. Former writers criticized xoJane for commodifying the personal stories of poorly paid young women writers (Stadtmiller 2016). Both websites' advertorial coverage of cosmetics and fashion evidence the ""suture"" between ""girliness"" in self-presentation and pose of feminist defiance noted in Gill's (2016) critique of popular feminism.
Indeed, readers themselves sometimes criticize the feminism of these sites' editorial stances. From their launch, both publications hosted reader comments and built followings of regular commenters. Jezebel's regulars began calling themselves ""Jezzies"" early in the life of the website (Smith 2017). Like Jezebel, xoJane's comments section attracted loyal and regular participants. The following comments on a Jezebel story about xoJane illustrate how regular commenters can build valued connections even as they criticize the websites where they meet (Peyser 2017). These comments also suggest the two publications share readers:
When xoJane closed a bunch of the sane, awesome commenters collectively started a Disqus channel so we wouldn't lose each other, but holy fuck so much of that place was awful. This exchange shows how commenters build relationships with one another despite using pseudonyms; they may even share their different pseudonyms with other users to stay in touch across various platforms. Furthermore, SerPounce'sNewCaretaker calls xoJane ""awful"" while recommending a new digital place where regular xoJane commenters can keep in touch, suggesting that people may visit such sites as much for interaction among commenters as for the site's content. Indeed, commenters produce free content which attracts readers to these sites.
The comments sections of these popular feminist publications recall Lauren Berlant's notion of an intimate public. According to Berlant (2008, 5):
An intimate public operates when a market opens up to a bloc of consumers, claiming to circulate texts and things that express those people's particular core interests and desires. When this kind of ""culture of circulation"" takes hold, participants in the intimate public feel as though it expresses what is common among them, a subjective likeness that seems to emanate from their history and their ongoing attachments and actions.
While intimate publics do not derive their intimacy from ""autobiographical confession and chest-baring,"" first-hand narratives play a significant part in their construction (Berlant 2008, viii). The intimate dimension of this imagined public lies in participants' sense of shared life histories and consequent ""common emotional world"" which makes them ""emotionally literate"" in each other's experiences (Berlant 2008, 5, 10). Thus, intimate publics of ""nondominant people"" flourish as an ""affective scene of identification among strangers that promises a certain experience of belonging and provides a complex of consolation, confirmation, discipline, and discussion about how to live as an x"" (Berlant 2008, viii). Berlant considers US ""women's culture"" as ""distinguished by a view that the people marked by femininity already have something in common and are in need of a conversation that feels intimate, revelatory, and a relief"" (Berlant 2008, ix).
Various scholars have deployed the concept of intimate public to understand affective attachments on digital media, which often involve sharing relatable experiences (AimÃ©e Morrison 2011;Anna Poletti 2011;Jacqueline Ryan Vickery 2014). Akane Kanai (2019) analyses the intimate public of a genre of young women's Tumblr blogging which uses funny GIFs and captions to light-heartedly dramatize everyday feminine lives. Kanai (2019, 5) describes these blogs as ""a digital space operating on a fantasy of fitting into a feminine generality, offering a sense of ongoing attachment through the expression of emotional likeness."" She explores the slippage between shared femininity and feminism evident in these blogs. Bloggers represent sexism as among the frustrations of feminine lives, with posts displaying confident, sassy responses to it. Confidence, repudiation of sexism, and support for other women become conflated with feminism in these blogs. Kanai (2019, 155) concludes they evidence a ""slippage between feminism and girlfriendship"" allowing for a ""reconstruction of feminism through the right kinds of feelings, attachments and detachments, ranging from the love of the best friend; being independent (of boyfriends); to being confident (at times).""
Both Jezebel and xoJane cultivate intimate publics based in a similarly stereotypically feminine/feminist emotional world and interest in topics such as celebrity gossip, fashion, shopping, and feminist politics. While Berlant (2008, viii, ix) suggests that intimate publics of nondominant people may offer ""critical assessment of the way things are,"" she argues that the intimate public of women's culture supports women in coping with the status quo rather than mobilizing them to fight for political change. Nevertheless, she expresses cautious optimism in the possibility of intimate publics to foster political resistance (Berlant 2008, ix). The participatory character of digital media may make such a possibility more likely. Below I consider literature on the potential of digital media for feminist consciousness-raising. Following this, I turn to analysis of Jezebel and xoJane comment threads on stories about sexual violence.
Feminist consciousness-raising and digital media
Some scholars have suggested that digital media have facilitated alternative forms of consciousness-raising for a new generation of feminists (Lindsay Kelland 2016; Tracy L. M. Kennedy 2007; Wendy K. Z. Anderson and Kittie E. Grace 2015). Consciousnessraising practices spread within the women's movement following the political turbulence of 1968 with the aim of generating new knowledge about women's social conditions. Groups of women met regularly to engage in structured discussions on their experiences of selected topics such as housework, childcare, and sex. According to one pioneer of the practice:
The importance of listening to a woman's feelings was collectively to analyze the situation of women, not to analyze her. The idea was not to change women, was not to make ""internal changes"" except in the sense of knowing more. It was and is the conditions women face, it's male supremacy, we want to change. (Kathie Sarachild 2012) Thus, these early consciousness-raising groups aimed to take women's emotions and experiences ""more seriously than any theories which did not satisfactorily clarify them, and to devise new theories which did reflect the actual experience and feelings and necessities of women"" (Sarachild 2012). Such groups produced feminist treatises and protest on issues such as domestic work and beauty contests as well as sexual violence (Carol Hanisch 2010).
According to Kelland, social media ""have shifted the boundaries of consciousnessraising in significant ways, including where these conversations can take place and who is permitted to join them"" (2016,735). She argues that past practices of face-to-face small group consciousness-raising produced groups whose members shared a similar social location. These groups' lack of heterogeneity limited the theoretical insights they produced, particularly because white women tended to generalize their experiences to all women (Kelland 2016, 736). Kelland (2016) suggests that consciousness-raising on social media could open conversations to diverse participants and thus produce more robust knowledge. She emphasizes the potential of social media consciousness-raising for sexual violence survivors' personal healing. Thus, she argues that feminists should revive ""consciousness-raising speak outs"" to help survivors avoid self-blame by providing a narrative of their experience as a product of systematic social patterns which should be addressed politically. Kelland's (2016) description of consciousness-raising recalls Carol Hanisch's (1969) account of the process as ""political therapy,"" involving women ""getting rid of self-blame"" for their ""sad situations"" and as allowing women to ""feel like we are thinking for ourselves for the first time in our lives."" However Hanisch, author of the seminal ""The Personal is Political,"" insists on the importance of face-to-face communication for feminist analysis and political mobilization, arguing that ""[s]afely settling in behind computers and interacting on Facebook and other social networks-though certainly useful-has its limits."" Conversely, Sarachild (2012), who along with Hanisch pioneered consciousness-raising groups in the United States, warns against rigid rules for the format of groups. Sarachild (2012) places more emphasis on consciousness-raising principles than format: ""the basic radical political principles of going to the original sources, both historic and personal, going to the people-women themselves, and going to experience for theory and strategy.""
Consciousness-raising in the comments section
Below I analyse examples from comment threads on two articles about sexual violence which offered rich discussions akin to consciousness-raising. The Jezebel article (Bobby Finger 2017) attracted 24,000 words of comments and the xoJane one (Emily McCombs 2012) 34,000 words. I do not present these comment threads as representative of responses to popular feminist media coverage of rape since a wider quantitative analysis would be necessary to support such a claim. Rather, I selected these comment threads as case studies of the possibilities and challenges for feminist consciousness-raising within the intimate feminist publics fostered by popular feminist media. Both threads inspired some commenters to tell stories of sexual violence and troubling heterosexual experiences which other commenters responded to and analysed. Stories about sexual violence on both sites typically attracted such disclosures and discussions; thus, these comment threads were not unusual for Jezebel and xoJane.
Drawing upon Norman Fairclough's (2013) techniques of critical discourse analysis, I examined word choice, metaphor, repeated phrases, themes, and narratives in these comment threads. I asked how participants discursively connected their stories and engaged in joint projects of analysis. I also considered how participants maintained a digital space which enabled nuanced conversations about sexual violence and heterosexual norms to unfold. Thus, I investigated how Jezebel, xoJane, and their commenters responded to disruptive and misogynist comments. Additionally, I examined the publicly available commenting history of one commenter accused of ""trolling"" on both Jezebel and xo Jane.
In December 2017 following widespread coverage of sexual violence and harassment allegations against powerful men, Jezebel published a piece about documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock's social media post calling himself ""part of the problem"" and disclosing his history of sexual harassment and an allegation of rape made against him by a woman he had ""hooked up"" with (no formal complaint was laid). According to Spurlock, we'd been drinking all night and went back to my room. We began fooling around, she pushed me off, then we laid in the bed and talked and laughed some more, and then began fooling around again. We took off our clothes. She said she didn't want to have sex, so we laid together, and talked, and kissed, and laughed, and then we started having sex. ""Light Bright,"" she said. ""What?"" ""Light bright. That kids toy, that's all I can see and think about,"" she said . . . and then she started to cry. I didn't know what to do. We stopped having sex and I rolled beside her. I tried to comfort her. To make her feel better. I thought I was doing ok, I believed she was feeling better. She believed she was raped. (quoted in Finger 2017) Sixteen Jezebel commenters drew on similar experiences to unpack Spurlock's account. For some, this conversation was illuminating, as in the following exchange:
How many of us have had this happen, the no is accepted but they keep trying. Ten mins later, twenty . . . basically if you stay and continue to chat or laugh or lay next to them or even kiss, they'll try again. Dudes, please stop doing this. If a woman says no, she means it. If you think she's signalling [sic] that she's changed her mind fucking ask first. Keeping her body in close proximity to yours isn't a yes. Continuing to talk to you isn't a yes. Kissing isn't a yes. (Oh Donnaaaaaaa! Donna Strunk!!! â†’ RumHamBaby)
The only noise in my head is ""aghhhhhhhh"" because this is so. fucking. true. Seeing it in writing from someone else . . . I didn't realize how long I'd been castigating myself for other people's lack of boundaries. (LadyOlennasHeadScarf â†’ Oh Donnaaaaaaa! Donna Strunk!!!)
In this extract the second commenter finds language in the first comment to describe her unease with past experiences of sexually persistent men; thus, she rejects self-blame. Other commenters also analysed situations where men persistently tried to persuade them to have intercourse after being told no, critiquing social norms of male pursuit of sex and female reticence which led ordinary men to rape without recognizing their actions as sexually violent. Commenting on one such story, Thomas J. Brown said: ""We are taught that women like to play games and need to be convinced. The 'fight' is all part of a game. If she allows you to have sex with her, then you've won the game."" Such conversations construct and disseminate feminist critique of heterosexual norms and their connection to sexual violence.
Emily McCombs (2011), xoJane's executive editor, published her article ""My Rapist Friended Me on Facebook (and All I Got Was This Lousy Article)"" on the launch of the website. A subsequent story entitled ""Why I Talk About Rape"" discussed how women commonly avoid labelling an experience as rape:
I hear women I know, time and time again, talk about ""bad experiences"" that have happened to them, ""unfortunate occurences,"" [sic] that resulted from ""putting themselves in a lot of bad situations."" Then they'll describe a rape. I am inappropriate in situations like these. I'll say, ""It sounds like you're not very emotionally connected to what happened to you."" I'll say, ""What you're describing is a sexual assault."" (McCombs 2012) This article prompted 77 commenters to discuss experiences which they had not always acknowledged as rape. 1 For example, one exchange went as follows:
When I was 18, my second boyfriend and I were fooling around in my car when all of a sudden he was inside me. I didn't want to do it with him yet, we had only just started dating and while I wasn't a virgin I also wasn't ready to have sex with my new boyfriend. But I didn't tell him to stop and after that sex was just sort of expected. I've never thought of it as rape but I also don't really see it as a consensual act. (Maggie_A) This is really similar to my story. Nine years ago, I felt like I was in the situation where I hadn't said no but I also hadn't said yes, but in the blink of an eye he was inside. I must have said no after he entered me, because his response was something along the lines of ""well there is nothing you can do now because I just took your virginity."" I had intentionally never used the term rape before. This article and some reader comments really made me stop a moment and consider the fact that whether I use the word or not, it still was what it was. I am hesitant to take the next step to re-process this incident. I just don't know if I am prepared to dig this shit up. (Heather â†’ Maggie_A) It's a difficult realization to make. I always thought of rape as something that was violent and forceful. That what happened to me wasn't rape because he wasn't rough or demanding. As upset I was [sic] the night that happened, I never once blamed him. I thought it was my fault because I never said no but now as an adult I wonder if he would have stopped if I had. (Maggie_A: â†’ Heather) Heather connects her story to Maggie_A's by echoing ""all of a sudden"" with ""in the blink of an eye."" Maggie_A elaborates that such rapes could be difficult to recognize because neither of their experiences looked ""violent and forceful."" By showing how a heterosexual encounter can quickly turn into rape, such conversations work to deconstruct the sharp dichotomy between rape and normal heterosex which structures much discussion about sexual violence.
Commenters on both websites also took the opportunity to question experiences where they acquiesced to unwanted sex. For example, in response to IonizedDare's observation on Jezebel that ""minus everything up to and including a PowerPoint presentation to explain my refusal usually gets heard as, 'I'm not sure, maybe',"" Mrs Jones says:
You're right . . . When I was young more than one guy ""convinced"" me when I didn't want to by simply wearing me down until I stopped fighting. I always felt like shit about it but I never held anyone accountable, even emotionally, for it. I think one guy even slut-shamed me afterwards. The sad part is that at the time I didn't think of it as being something wrong with the way they were treating me, rather I internalized it as being too weak to stand up for myself. This comment problematizes heterosexual male persistence as causing emotional damage to female partners who give in to it. Similarly, on xoJane, thirtiesgirl questions an incident where she complied with the sexual demands of a neighbour after he helped carry her groceries:
I have a question about an early sexual experience of mine. I've never considered it rape because I didn't say no to the guy and didn't try to stop him from having sex with me. But I wonder how others will perceive it. . . . Before and during our sexual activities he said and did some things I never want to experience again. When he took of his bottoms, he told me to get a measuring tape and measure his erect penis. He wasn't joking when he said it. I didn't want to, but I did it. When we were having sex, he told me to say he's the ""biggest, best black dick"" I'd ever had. He's African American; I'm white, and he knew (correctly) that he was the first African American guy I'd had sex with. Again, he wasn't joking when he said it, and he made me say it several times. I didn't want to, but I did it. . . . So I'm wondering if others see this as rape. I've never named it as such because I consented. However, I was in a very bad emotional state and my confidence was at an all-time low.
Other commenters agreed the experience was not rape but affirmed thirtiesgirl's emotional reaction:
You consented to the sex so it's not rape but I would feel violated by being (or just feeling) coerced into saying something I didn't want to say; I can see why it's disturbing to you. (Msdinahmoehumm â†’ thirtiesgirl)
""not really rape"" doesn't mean it was ok, that he is a decent guy or even that he hasn't or wouldn't ever rape someone else. . . . Since you were affected enough by it to still be thinking of it, I am thinking . . . the measuring the dick thing and the ""say what I tell you to"" thing were really uncomfortable and coercive in a bad way. . . . If I knew him and you told me this story I'd definitely tell everyone I knew to stay away from him. (MarieKersey â†’ thirtiesgirl)
These comments link coercive sexual conduct that falls short of rape with rape by acknowledging that it understandably created feelings of violation and a sense of distress.
These examples show that popular feminist websites can provide space for women to examine troubling sexual experiences without the constraint of a binary rape/normal heterosex framework of evaluation and the social implications of categorizing an experience as rape or not. Research has found that women may not problematize their coercive sexual experiences because normative heterosexual scripts assume men's ""forthright urgent pursuit of sexual 'release' "" and ""women's passive, acquiescing (a) sexuality"" (Nicola Gavey 2005, 3). Yet these comment threads produced an analysis of rape as a predictable product of heterosexual social scripts, as heterogeneous, and as existing on a continuum with less extreme forms of sexual coercion and aggression. Thus, these comment threads allowed participants to question their understanding of normal heterosexual conduct.
Consciousness-raising groups clearly differ from comment threads: the interaction is face to face rather than digital, following structures designed to produce knowledge about women's political situation and transform it. Commercial media comments sections aim to enlist readers in producing content with which to attract further readers and encourage return visits to the website. Nevertheless, the conversations discussed above followed the basic consciousness-raising principle of taking women's experiences seriously and theorizing from them to produce knowledge about gender and power. While participants did not follow clear structures, they did follow affective norms and managed obstructive contributions as discussed in the following two sections.
Constructing an intimate public through communication of affect and empathy
Participants in conversations about sexual violence on both Jezebel and xoJane told nuanced stories of sexual coercion in the expectation that other participants would be, in Berlant's (2008, 5) terms, ""emotionally literate"" enough to hear their story and respond with empathy. On xoJane, commenters described the site as providing a supportive community where they could speak honestly about sexual violence and coercion. For example, one comment on McCombs' (2012) article said:
I was raped at the age of 3. This is the first time I've typed such words publicly. My FiancÃ©e, therapist, mother & 2 close friends are the only people who knew this fact until now; that's how much I trust, adore & Love this site. The editors/writers/Jane. The readers/registered users. xoJane encouragees [sic] brutal honesty (which I love) while maintaining a concurrent feeling of safety. My only online refuge. (Guest)
In the absence of face-to-face interaction, commenters cultivated a supportive environment through their use of emotionally descriptive language. On xoJane, readers referred to bodily ""chills"" and described various bodily reactions-for example, in their stomachs and hearts-to convey their emotional response. For example: Emily, just . . . wow. I love you I love you I love you for writing this. I'm sitting at my desk in my office in tears. I AM that person and it feels so good to know I'm not alone-I've had several ""bad experiences"" that I've denied and never fully dealt with because I was afraid of being the ""rape girl"" and being judged or pitied or stigmatized. . . . Those times I felt dirty and sad and forced-it's because it WAS forced! Your bravery and openness are amazingmuch love to you and every other woman dealing with the confusion and private shame of sexual assault. We're not alone! (emily323) chills, emily. this is the kind of story that makes me want to hop [on] a plane to new york and hug the awesomeness that is you. xo! (Xobolaji) Yes, total chills. This is perfect. My stomach turns just reading about your experiences. (HATE that that is plural.) Thanks for this. Likewise, readers offered each other sympathetic support and responded to such support with description of their emotional reaction to it, as in the following exchange: i call the things that have happened in my past ""bad experiences"" when i talk about them at all. it has always been someone that i know when i was fucked up out of my mind. i can't wrap my head around it being rape. maybe this article will help. (Traci) Believe that you are, and always have been, deserving of respect. Believe that you deserve the right to give or withhold consent about your body. Try to understand that when you are fucked up out of your mind, you cannot give consent. Go from there. (CatherineHeron â†’ Traci) that made me tear up. (Traci â†’ CatherineHeron)
Telling each other about their tears, chills, and other emotional sensations facilitated commenters' willingness to discuss their distressing stories.
Participants often shared their stories to show empathy; thus, responses to stories of sexual violence on both publications regularly begin with phrases such as ""This is really similar to my story."" While making such connections contributed to the analytical work of these conversations, the phrase also communicated empathy. Commenters took care to acknowledge disclosures of sexual violence; for example, when commenter ""EdnasEdibles"" disclosed in a comment on Jezebel's Spurlock story (Finger 2017) that a date let himself into her empty apartment uninvited, waited in the dark for her to return, and then pressured her into unwanted sex, two commenters responded: Here, both commenters use the stock phrase ""I'm sorry that happened to you"" and bayougirl shares her own fears to affirm the horror of E",6601,7727
10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508855,,,False,Shazwani Nur,A Study of Reddit-User's Response to Rape,"
The growth of social media has created an open web where people freely share their opinion and even discuss sensitive subjects in online forums. Forums such as Reddit help support seekers by serving as a portal for open discussions for various stigmatized subjects such as rape. This paper investigates the potential roles of online forums and if such forums provide intended resources to the people who seek support. Specifically, the open nature of forums allows us to study how online users respond to seeker's queries or needs; through their response, we attempt to assess the range of topics covered by responders in regards to the issues, concerns and, obstacles faced by the victims of rape and sexual abuse, using rape-related posts from Reddit. We employ natural language processing techniques to extract topics of responses, examine how diverse these topics are to answer research questions such as whether responses are limited to emotional support; if not, what other topics are; what the diversity of topics manifests; and how online response differs from traditional response found in a physical world.
",2018,,,"I. INTRODUCTION
Online forums such as Reddit and Volt have emerged as a portal for victims and survivors of rape and sexual abuse to come together in a mutually supportive and safe environment [1]. Rape is a subject of social stigma that restricts victims from openly sharing their experience due to the following reasons: (1) concern about confidentiality, (2) fear of not being believed and (3) feeling of guilt and embarrassment. Unlike traditional support groups, the anonymity of online forums encourages users to break the mold and express their emotions and feelings with less fear and guilt. In this paper, we extract Reddit posts on rape to understand the nature of user responses to address the following questions:
(1) What are the most frequently discussed topics? (2) Are responses always emotional and sympathetic?
(3) What are other topics that are found in response to a victim's query? (4) What are the ramifications of these diverse topics?
Addressing the above questions is a non-trivial task due to the following reasons. First, when it comes to the stigmatized issue, it is not easy for researchers to find the right resource because it is compounded by one's personal nature and mental health. Second, people discuss a wide range of aspects when it comes to rape and sexual abuse. Third, victims are usually reluctant to express their feelings on open social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.
II. DATA COLLECTION
Although there are several online forums, Redditfoot_0 has emerged as the best candidate for exploring stigmatized issues [2]. We crawled the set of all posts that correspond to the topics on ""Rape and Sexual Abuse"". From every post, we collect a variety of meta-data such as the title of the post, textual contents, timestamp (i.e., the time of posting), author id, and the number of upvotes and downvotes. Our dataset consists of 950 unique posts, with an average of ten responses per post.
III. STUDYING USER RESPONSE

A. Understanding the Common Problems
We begin our analysis by gaining a global understanding of the problem. Table I reports the bi-gram and tri-gram of our dataset. Unsurprisingly, we see the term sexual abuse as the most frequently discussed word. We also observe some interesting words that pertain to entities such as mom, dad which reveals the type of people who play an important role in a victim's situation and recovery. People also seem to frequently use words that convey emotions such as feel safe and experiencing dealing outside. In addition to this, the bigram please help shows that people acknowledge Reddit as a secure platform to seek help for stigmatized issues like rape.   ""Should I take legal action for my justice"" case, court, police, guilty, trial ""Legally, the RCCs aren't allowed to discriminate, but it's true that they're oriented more toward the needs of female victims."" ""I don't report because lack of evidence"" victim, evidence, crime, domestic service ""I'd say it may not be worth re-traumatizing yourself to go forward with a trial where there's no physical evidence to back it up.""
B. Analysis of Semantic Categories
Our second goal is to understand whether responses are always emotional and sympathetic to the victim's post. To answer this, we use the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Counts package (LIWC). Table II shows the words that pertain to the corresponding categories. Obviously, we see a category like sad, which signifies strong emotion and sympathy; however, we also observe some inconspicuous categories such as money and religion. We see that money is frequently associated with words such as cost, wealthy, while religion is associated with hell, confession. To get a deeper understanding of these issues, we used the words associated with money and religion (i.e., Table II) as search queries to retrieve responses that pertain to these queries. When it comes to money-related issues, we found that responses were mostly about the cost associated with therapy and seeking professional help. For example, consider the following responses:
â€¢ ""Seeing anyone professionally isnt a financial possibility, I cannot take anti-depressants even if I had money for a prescriber and meds"".
When it comes to religion, we found that victims usually deal with conflicting emotions due to confounding theories between religion and sex. An example is shown below:
â€¢ ""My girlfriend is abusing my religion and me, I feel like suicidal...""
C. Extracting Useful Topics
Our third goal is to extract a broad range of topics that are relevant to the victim's post (or query). To achieve this, we train the LDA topic model to retrieve topic distributions related to rape. First, we manually select some important queries from the actual postings of users. Second, we use these query words as search tokens to filter out topics that had an exact match with the query in the top five ranked list of words. These topic clusters provide us with more relevant words that are related to the query words. The first Column in Table III shows the actual user query and the underlined set of words indicate the keywords in these queries and the second column shows the topical words that are relevant to these query terms. It is interesting to see that the discussions of people are not confined to emotional support. On the contrary, our results reveal that insurance is also one of the main concerns when it comes to a health-related issue such as getting sick, medical treatment, therapy, etc. Similarly, legal advice is another interesting topic we discovered through our methodology.
D. Recommending Relevant Solutions
Finally, we are ready to understand the ramifications of these diverse set of topics. To achieve this, we use topical words (see the second column of Table III) to retrieve the actual responses of users that match with these topics. The results of this outcome are depicted in the final column of Table III, where one can observe the responses related to issues such as relationship, therapy, court, and justice. For example, when it comes to queries on therapy, respondents suggest the victims explore many options before deciding on the right therapist. More importantly, when it comes to topics on legal advice, justice, and evidence there seem to be many confounding responses with discussions talking about the validity of physical evidence, discrimination between male and female sexes, and conflicting opinions on whether to proceed with the trial or not. This clearly shows that user responses are diverse and not limited to emotional support.
IV. CONCLUSION
This work reports the linguistic behavior of communication among users in Reddit forums. The main contributions are summarized as follows: (1) Reddit can be the source of finding resources for a stigmatized issue such as rape, (2) unveil interesting topic cluster by using LDA that proves some communication among users does help them to find a resource, (3) prove that discussion scope among users is significantly beyond social support due to the anonymity feature of Reddit. We believe that this can lead to more interesting future work with more in-depth studies involving both seekers and responders via survey methods as in classic longitudinal studies.",1420,1556

Using Internet-related ethnography (Postill & Pink, 2012), we examined the role of social media in campus sexual violence activism. Based on observations of online activist communities and interviews with 23 activists, we highlight raising awareness, community building, and interrupting power dynamics as activism strategies enhanced by social media. Further, we provide implications and recommendations for administrators, educators, and student activists.

Feminist activists and scholars have challenged rape culture on campuses for decades, yet the recent attention paid to this issue in the United States is unparalleled. In 2013, students from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill filed a Title IX complaint with the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) challenging the ways administrators handled their sexual assault complaints (Schnoebelen, 2013). Since then, student activists on over 150 campuses have filed complaints with the OCR making campus sexual assault a top priority for the U.S. federal government (Kingkade, 2016). These complaints, coupled with national media attention (e.g., CNN, The New York Times, Time Magazine, Glamour, etc.), contributed to a shift in momentum that led President Obama to develop the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault (White House Council on Women and Girls, 2014).
Student activists, armed with passion and technological know-how, fueled this shift in momentum (Grasgreen, 2013). Campus activists took to Twitter to raise awareness about a victim-blaming editorial written by George Will in 2014. Using the hashtag #survivorprivilege, activists described their harrowing experiences with reporting sexual violence on their campuses (Kingkade, 2014). Additionally in 2014, Emma Sulkowitz, a senior at Columbia University, pledged to carry a mattress around campus with her until the man who sexually assaulted her was removed from campus. Sulkowitz's activism resulted in the hashtag #CarryThat-Weight trending on Twitter and students on other campuses setting up mattress displays as consciousness-raising events on their campuses (Nathanson, 2014).
More recently, Brock Turner, a Stanford University swimmer was found guilty for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman, yet the judge in his case, Aaron Persky, sentenced him to only 6 months in jail because a longer sentence in prison would have a ""severe impact"" on him (Koren, 2016, para. 6). Social media users led a campaign to have Persky removed from his judicial position. While he was not removed as a judge, he was removed from presiding over a new sexual assault case (Fantz, Sidner, & Karimi, 2016).
Some popular media outlets have described the importance of social media in sexual violence activism (Ludden, 2014), yet little scholarship has examined the role of social media in campus-based sexual violence activism. In this study, we examine the strategies of campus sexual violence activists, including the role of social media in sexual violence activism. To provide a context for this study, we synthesize literature on student activism with specific attention to the intersection of social identities, power, and campus activism. Next, we describe Internet-related ethnography (Postill & Pink, 2012) as a methodology for examining strategies of sexual violence activists and the significance of social media. Finally, we describe and discuss findings from our observations and interviews with sexual assault activists, and provide implications for those supporting campusbased activists.
Student Activism
Activism refers to organizing to transform systems of oppression for comprehensive social change (Broadhurst, 2014;Renn, 2007). Student activism has been present in some form on college campuses since they were founded, as college and university campuses have long been sites of awareness of and attention to social issues. For example, students have protested wars throughout history, beginning with the Revolutionary War in the late 1700s (Altbach, 1989;Broadhurst, 2014). Additionally, student activists have frequently advocated that college and university administrators practice ethics in their investment and business practices (Altbach, 1989). Students in early U.S. colonial colleges boycotted and urged administrators to boycott British goods (Broadhurst, 2014); students in the 1980s argued for divestment, urging administrators not to engage in business with countries and businesses with unethical practices (Rhoads, 1998). More recently, student activists have challenged administrators to consider business with prison labor and sweatshops (Einwohner & Spencer, 2005).
Identity and Activism
Parallel to larger movements in U.S. culture, student activists have also engaged in activism related to their own experiences with marginalization and oppression (Rhoads, 1997). In conjunction with the larger Civil Rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s, Black and Chicano students and a few White allies worked toward racial integration on campuses (Caple, 1998;Pratt, 2002;Rhoads, 1998). Similarly, the U.S. women's movement of the 1970s and 1980s resulted in women students on college campuses raising awareness about their experiences with rape and additional sexual violence (Bevacqua, 2000). As the U.S. LGBT movement gained momentum in the 1990s, queer college students also advocated for inclusion and representation on college campuses through LGBT resource centers and nondiscrimination statements (Rhoads, 1998). Today, as transgender people seek greater visibility and protection from violence, queer and trans students on campuses also advocate for this visibility and safety (Erbentraut, 2016). Some argue that the Occupy Movement of the early 2000s, a movement raising awareness about class inequities largely led by college students, resulted in increased awareness about student loan debt (Vara, 2014). As immigration issues garnered more attention nationally, undocumented students rallied to raise awareness about the challenges they faced in gaining access to higher education and the legal issues surrounding their citizenship status (MuÃ±oz, 2015).
This identity-based activism may have consequences for student activists. Students engaged in activism related to sweatshop labor and other international and national issues that have less of a direct impact on college and university daily practices are frequently heralded as student leaders and activists while students engaged in activism related to their own identities on college campuses (e.g., racial discrimination, sexual assault, and immigration status) are frequently seen as troublemakers or rabble-rousers by administrators (Linder, 2015). Additionally, students of Color, queer and trans students, working-class or poor students, and undocumented students face differential consequences with legal and conduct-related processes than their heterosexual cisgender White middle-class peers. Given the history of racism, transphobia, and homophobia in criminal justice systems (Alexander, 2012;Mogul & Ritchie, 2011), minoritized students arrested for civil disobedience experience significantly different ramifications, including harsher sentences and lack of safety in jail cells, than do students with mostly dominant identities. Similarly, the longterm consequences of an arrest are significantly different for people with minoritized identities who already experience discrimination in hiring practices. For example, a person of Color without a criminal record is less likely to be hired than a White person with a criminal record (Ross, 2014); additionally, unemployment rates for people of Color and trans people are astronomically high (Center for American Progress, 2015;Ross, 2014), resulting in a greater need for pristine records when applying for jobs that are already difficult to receive.
Social Media and Activism
As illustrated here, engaging in ""traditional"" forms of activism has differential consequences for different people, resulting in the significance of social media as a counterspace for people with minoritized identities. In recent years, scholars have explored cyberactivism or digital activism in a variety of disciplines, including media studies (Williams, 2015), communication (Gerbaudo & TrerÃ©, 2015), technology studies (Fatkin & Lansdown, 2015), political science (Margetts, John, Hale, & Reissfelder, 2015), and women's studies (Newsom & Lengel, 2012;Stephan, 2013). Cyberactivism refers to ways people ""use digital tools to effect social and political change"" (Amin, 2009(Amin, -2010, p. 64), p. 64). Activists have taken advantage of ""new"" technology throughout history; for example, the invention of the TV significantly influenced the coverage of the voting protests in Selma, Alabama in the 1960s (Bonilla & Rosa, 2015). Today's ""new"" technology includes social media and the Internet, though most activists who use social media consider it a ""mundane internet tool"" (Nielsen, 2013, p. 173); the Internet and social media are a part of their everyday experience, a tool they use for a variety of reasons, including activism.
Early cyberactivism in the United States included organizers using online spaces to ""take on the World Trade Organization"" (Sandova-Almazan & Gil-Garcia, 2014, p. 365) and the hacker group ""Anonymous"" that interrupted the websites of major religious, government, and corporate organizations (Sandova-Almazan & Gil-Garcia, 2014). Some scholars argue the Arab Spring, a social movement that eventually overthrew the government in Egypt in 2011, was fueled by social media (Sandova-Almazan & Gil-Garcia, 2014), though other scholars caution against overstating the influence of social media on this movement as mass access to the Internet in North African countries during this time was limited (Newsom & Lengel, 2012).
Some scholars argued that cyberactivism would not translate to real activism, and coined the term ""slacktivism"" to highlight the ways in which people could demonstrate awareness of social and political issues without actually engaging in action (Fatkin & Lansdown, 2015;Glenn, 2015). More recent scholarship highlights the ways online and offline engagement intersect; they do not exist in isolation of one another (Bonilla & Rosa, 2015;Fatkin & Lansdown, 2015;Nielsen, 2013). Nielsen (2013) calls for researchers to ""reject the notion that the very use of the internet necessarily leads to one or the other form of activism"" (p. 174). Online spaces provide opportunities for people to engage in less hierarchical activism and amplify the voices of people otherwise ignored by mainstream media outlets as highlighted below (Bonilla & Rosa, 2015;Williams, 2015).
Those who argue online activism is ""slacktivism"" fail to consider ways in which online activism contributes to the increased visibility of minoritized communities and provides unique opportunities for connection and solidarity (Bonilla & Rosa, 2015). Not only does online activism amplify voices of many people historically ignored in mainstream media, it also provides an important counterspace for minoritized people to come together to share stories, feel less isolated, and begin to heal from their experiences with trauma (Conley, 2014).
Cyberfeminism
Cyberfeminism refers to ""the intersection of gender and the Internet"" (Cunningham & Crandall, 2014, p. 76). Although cyberfeminism is not exclusively about activism, feminist activism in online spaces is a part of cyberfeminism. Globally, feminists have organized in online spaces for decades. Scholars documented the Arab Spring as model for cyberactivism, and even more specifically, cyberfeminism, calling attention to the ways in which Arab women used online spaces to connect with each other and find solidarity related to their experiences with oppression during the Arab Spring (Newsom & Lengel, 2012). Feminists in other non-U.S. countries have engaged social media to address issues of violence against women. For example, women in South Africa organized via social media to raise money for the Saartjie Baartman Centre as it faced significant financial difficulties in the 2010s (Mudavanhu & Radloff, 2013). Similarly, women in Spain organized to raise awareness about violence against women using social media to ""organize direct actions, share information and resources, and coordinate activities"" (Puente, 2011, p. 335). Feminists in Egypt used Twitter, Facebook, and mobile phones to develop HarassMap, an interactive tool in both English and Arabic through which people can document the location and specific details of an experience with sexual harassment. The tool is designed to ""undermine the climate of social acceptability for sexual harassers"" (Peuchaud, 2014, p. i115). Using HarassMap, feminists in additional North African countries have used social media to share women's stories of harassment and assault, ""detailing the brutality and frequency of sexual harassment"" (Skalli, 2014, p. 245).
In the United States, women of Color have used social media to address issues of oppression and violence. Because Western feminist movements and Arab American organizations did not meet the needs of Arab American women, they used social media to connect with each other and form feminist communities of solidarity (Stephan, 2013). Similarly, because mainstream media outlets and feminist organizations have ignored Black women's experiences with sexual violence, Black feminists have used online spaces to raise awareness about violence against Black women. Building on Collins' (2000) work highlighting the significance of ""safe spaces"" (p. 98) for Black feminists to come together to ""contest the ideologies that perpetuate the objectification and oppression of Black women"" (Rapp, Button, Fleury-Steiner, & Fleury-Steiner, 2010, p. 249), online environments have become spaces for Black women to grieve the loss of community members and to ""authenticate their voices"" (Rapp et al., 2010, p. 249). Conley (2014) argues hashtags created by Black feminist communities describe ""technologies of crossing . . . tactics to counteract the emotional and psychological trauma of marginalization, colonization, and essentially death"" (p. 1112). Hashtags such as #RememberingRenisha, #IStandWithJada, and #WhyWeCantWait represent spaces where Black women have come together in solidarity and to tell the stories of Black women otherwise ignored by media and feminist and Black civil rights organizations (Conley, 2014;Rapp et al., 2010;Williams, 2015).
Building on the frameworks presented here, we explore the strategies of campus sexual violence activists and the role of social media in campus-based activism. Through interviews with 23 campus sexual assault activists and prolonged engagement with a variety of online groups related to campus sexual violence prevention and response, we highlight social media as a tool for consciousness-raising, community building, and as a counterspace for sexual assault activism. We conclude with implications for scholars and educators striving to support campus activists to create a shift in campus culture related to sexual violence.
Methodology and Method
Supported by a feminist epistemology (Alcoff & Potter, 1993), we employ Internetrelated ethnography (Postill & Pink, 2012) as a methodological framework to examine role of social media in sexual assault activism. Feminist epistemology centers the voices of historically marginalized groups, including women and people of Color to critique the way power relationships influence the construction of knowledge. Although the term feminist may imply to some readers that the primary category of analysis is gender, feminist epistemologists argue that ""gender can never be observed as a 'pure' or solitary influence"" (Alcoff & Potter, 1993, p. 3).
The research questions for this study included: What are the strategies of campus sexual assault activists? What role did social media play in campus sexual assault activism?
In feminist qualitative research, researchers work to develop relationships with the participants to enhance data collection and to use their previous knowledge and experience with a phe-nomenon in the construction of knowledge (Mertens, 2010). For this reason, we describe our researcher perspectives. Members of this research team included four cisgender women with current or previous experiences working in campus-based women's centers, supporting sexual violence survivors and activists. Three identify as White and one as Black; two identify as queer and two as straight. All researchers possess some form of educational privilege with all four having earned a master's degree in student affairs and higher education, one has earned a PhD, and two are in doctoral programs in higher education and student affairs.
Internet-Related Ethnography
Ethnographic researchers engage in data collection over a prolonged period of time, attempting to understand a culture of interest or a phenomenon (Wolcott, 2008). Building on ethnographic methodology, scholars use Internetrelated ethnography to examine the role of social media in the development of communities and processes (Postill & Pink, 2012). Internetrelated ethnography allows researchers to create ethnographic places ""that traverse online/offline contexts and are collaborative, participatory, open and public"" (Postill & Pink, 2012, p. 124) to create ""deep, contextual and contingent understandings produced through intensive and collaborative sensory, embodied engagements"" (Postill & Pink, 2012, p. 125). Researchers using Internet-related ethnography integrate traditional forms of data collection, like interviews, with new forms of data collection, including engaging in online communities. We used Postill and Pink's (2012) strategy of ""living part of one's life on the Internet, keeping up-to-date and participating and collaborating in social media discussions"" (p. 128) as part of our data collection strategy.
We engaged in data collection over a period of 8 months, including interviews with campus activists and engagement with online communities dedicated to sexual violence response and prevention. Following the recommended protocol of ""catching up, sharing, exploring, interacting, and archiving"" (Postill & Pink, 2012, p. 128), we observed online communities related to sexual violence activism. Catching up and exploring included reviewing social media daily for updates about sexual violence prevention and response on campuses. We did this by following activists Twitter and ""liking"" Facebook groups dedicated to sexual assault activism on college campuses. We regularly ""liked,"" ""favorited,"" and shared information we learned in these groups by reposting or retweeting stories we saw online, meeting the ""sharing"" strategy of Internet-related ethnography. Finally, we archived newspaper articles and blog posts in an Evernote notebook, fulfilling the archiving strategy.
Specifically, we followed the Know Your IX Facebook Group and several conversations on Twitter, including but not limited to #survivorprivilege, #RapeCultureIsWhen, and #KnowY-ourIX. We also occasionally observed Tumblr and Instagram when posts on Facebook and Twitter directed us there. The Evernote notebook included 304 notes, including clipped newspaper articles, screenshots of text message exchanges between members of the research team, reflections about trending topics on Twitter and Facebook, notes about sexual assaultrelated programs and events we attended on our campuses, and researcher reflections immediately after interviews with activists.
For the interview portion of the study, we identified participants by reviewing articles from national news sources (e.g., The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, and Huffington Post) and compiled a list of activists named in those articles. We contacted 28 potential participants through various forms of social media, posted a call for participants through Facebook and Twitter, and sent a call for participants to a women's center staff list-serv. We sought ""current or recent students engaged in sexual assault activism"" and ""who use social media."" After each interview, we asked participants to share the call for participants with their networks, resulting in a snowball sample. We interviewed campus activists using Skype or Google Hangout; interviews lasted between 45 min and 2 hr, with the majority of interviews lasting about 1 hr. We audio recorded and transcribed the interviews for analysis purposes. We asked activists to describe the current state of the sexual assault movement and to share their perspectives related to a national shift in momentum. We also asked participants about their social media habits and how their social identities related to their activism.
Participants
Twenty-three activists involved with campus sexual assault activism on the national and local levels in the United States participated in this study. Participants included current undergraduate students (11), graduate students (2), and recent alumni (10), ranging in age from 19 -37 with 16 participants between the ages of 19 -24. Five participants attended college in the Southeastern region of the United States, five in the mid-Atlantic, four in the West, two in the Mountain West, three in the Midwest, three in the Northeast, and one in the Northwest. Fourteen participants attended public institutions, including one community college; nine attended private institutions. Of the 23 participants, three identified themselves as men; 20 as women and none as transgender. Ten activists identified themselves as White, six Asian, five multiracial, two Latina, and no one identified themselves as African American or Native American. Fifteen participants identified as heterosexual, six identified as queer, one as bisexual, and one participant preferred not to answer.
Data Analysis
All four researchers were involved in the data analysis process, which included a three-cycle coding process (SaldaÃ±a, 2009). Each transcript was read by two members of the research team. In the first cycle of coding, the researchers reviewed the transcripts, making note of initial codes relevant to the research questions. Codes like ""Facebook"" and ""timing"" and ""raising awareness"" and ""resistance"" emerged in this round of coding. In the second round of analysis, the researchers discussed the initial codes generated and developed a list of common codes, collapsed by similarity and overlap from the first round, then reread and recoded the transcripts using the agreed upon codes. Finally, the researchers regrouped the codes into overarching themes (SaldaÃ±a, 2009), including ""Identity and Intersectionality,"" ""Social Media Strategies,"" and ""Challenges with Social Media.""
We ensured trustworthiness through a variety of strategies including prolonged engagement and rich description, triangulation, and peer debriefing and review (Lincoln, 2001). Engaging in data collection for a period of 18 months and describing the participants' perspectives in significant detail contributes to the prolonged engagement and rich description strategy. Additionally, we collected data from a variety of sources ensuring triangulation of our data. Finally, we met regularly throughout the data collection and analysis processes, discussing our reactions, observations, and findings, meeting the peer debriefing expectation of trustworthiness.
Findings
Activists' overall strategies are detailed elsewhere, including intentionally crafting messages, shifting the frameworks for sexual assault awareness from victim to activist, and connection and collaboration with other activists (Linder, Riggle, & Myers, 2014). In this paper, we illuminate the role of social media in sexual assault activism. Specifically, activists highlighted social media as a tool for consciousness-raising and calls to action, an opportunity to connect with other activists, and as a counterspace to reduce power dynamics present in other spaces.
Awareness-Raising and Calls to Action
Despite claims that social media activism is not real activism (McCafferty, 2011), participants in this study highlighted the role of social media in raising awareness and calling people to action. Several activists in this study noted the significance of social media in reaching audiences they may not have previously reached. Keri highlighted the significance of social media in her experience, ""it's created this system and this ability for us to talk about [sexual violence] and to share our stories"" and has allowed people to join a movement by saying publicly that they support or want to change something.
Several participants shared examples demonstrating both intentionality and intuition when using social media for raising awareness and calling their peers to action. These participants relied on their previous experiences with social media to inform how they used it; yet, they were also explicitly intentional about using specific media in different ways. For example, Charlotte shared an example of taking advantage of the popular Instagram hashtag #TBT, Throwback Thursday, to keep her followers engaged. She posted a picture of a fraternity man involved in their prevention program holding up a shirt that said ""I will . . ."" and what he would do to prevent sexual violence as a part of Throwback Thursday. She said, ""I think that was one of the most liked posts because he was really popular . . . and it showed that he still had some influence over his peers there."" Charlotte intentionally utilized a specific medium and a popular hashtag to reach people who may not have otherwise seen a post about sexual violence. Several participants mentioned this strategy, and we observed it through our online engagement on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook throughout the research period. For example, one user posted on her Instagram account a photo of herself with tape covering her mouth wearing a t-shirt that said ""stop rape culture"" with several hashtags and the caption ""FIND. YOUR. VOICE."" The Know Your IX Facebook group posted informational stories on a daily basis, with most of those stories showing dozens to hundreds of additional shares within a few hours.
Similarly, Janet described how she intentionally used both Tumblr and Facebook to reach different people, ""a story on Tumblr reaches those people who follow you on Tumblr or looks at the Tumblr regularly. And posting that same link to Facebook reaches people on Facebook who aren't otherwise looking at the Tumblr."" Conversely, Joseph described using his intuition to know when to post on Facebook to get the most attention. He explained, It was just my own kind of sense of how things are . . . I've worked for other offices . . . and we put out a lot of programs. So whenever we put out flyers on Facebook, I'd simply notice when more likes would come up and when more people would see this stuff.
He said that coming into his role in his campus activist group, he had a ""sense of how things worked online."" Charlotte, Janet, and Joseph described strategies for using social media to raise awareness about sexual assault. In addition to raising awareness, activists also described using social media to call people to action.
Lory, self-described as resistant to social media, shared her evolution of coming to understand social media as a strategy to engage people in action. She said, ""I was so not into social media . . . I just wasn't interested."" However, when she needed a way to reach more students, she created a Facebook group for the Interpersonal Violence Taskforce she was cochairing. She shared that 200 people joined the Facebook group and ""all of these people I didn't know would show up to volunteer trainings, would show up to different meetings we had for student government and it was really awesome."" She explained that people seemed ""really excited to channel [energy] into something"" and she would offer opportunities for people to show up at a meeting or write policy makers and they ""would totally do it.""
Finally, activists described using social media as a way to hold institutions accountable for their actions by raising awareness about the ways many colleges and universities failed to adequately address sexual violence. Sally highlighted that social media created ""a big shift that I think is vital for this issue."" Instead of spending time convincing people that sexual assault is a problem on campuses, ""now colleges and universities are being put on the spot."" Parents and students applying to colleges are now saying, ""We know this is happening, what are you doing about it?"" Further, Sam described the significance of watchdog groups that anonymously highlighted experiences of survivors and the ways in which universities handle sexual assault. Exposure to these stories ""led to even more unrest within the students in terms of how the university deals with cases like these,"" leading to ""accountability being greatly maximized via the internet.""
Activists relied on intention and intuition to effectively use social media for raising awareness, including calls to action and institutional accountability related to sexual assault. Additionally, participants described using social media as a tool for building community with other activists and survivors as a key organizing strategy.
Community Building
Activists highlighted the importance of social media in providing opportunities for building community, a key strategy for sexual assault activism (Linder et al., 2014;Williams, 2015). Lynn asserts ""the movement began"" because so many of us were going to the media, so many of us were talking on social media, so many of us were intentionally connecting our cases. . . . And there was a way for us to know that this was happening on other campuses. Essentially it gave survivors the opportunity to say 'me too.'
In addition, Sally highlighted the importance of using social media to build on the long history of activism related to sexual assault. She observed, ""there has been activism in some form for so long . . . decades of really good work."" She continued, explaining the significance of the ""networking that's happening between campuses"" by highlighting examples of times students from different campuses would connect with each other to share strategies. Sally's reflection highlights the significance of the activists who came before her, recognizing the ways in which today's activism advances the work of a long history of activism on college campuses and in larger communities.
Several participants specifically discussed the IX Network Facebook group as a place where they connected with other activists and learned about challenges and successes on other campuses related to sexual violence. As researchers, we did not observe the IX Network Group because it was a closed group, and we did not have permission to observe private groups. According multiple participants, the IX Network Group had over 900 members during the time of data collection. Peter and Amanda both described the significance of the group in eerily similar ways. Peter said, Using Facebook is a tool to network, it's also a tool to workshop ideas, to workshop pieces. I cannot think of a single major activist in the movement who is not on Facebook, who is not connected to a ton of people through that, I mean you can rattle off the names of people . . . and they're all connected, everyone is connected to each other, connected to the greater movement.
Amanda echoed the sentiments about ""workshopping ideas"" and continued that for her, the IX Network ""has been the most valuable tool in terms of education. I have learned so much from that Facebook page and everybody sharing resources.""
Additionally, Chad explained how he connected with other survivor-activists after an OpEd piece he wrote for his school newspaper was widely shared, Twenty years ago before the Internet was around, that article would have been read by maybe a few hundred people at the university, right? But there is no way it would have been spread around the country, got comments and reactions from around the country. There is no way I would have been put in contact with student leaders at all these major universities if it was not for social media. I mean, it got 3,000 Facebook likes.
In addition to activists building community for continued progress on their campuses, participants also discussed the importance of community for survivors. Ariel described the importance of online spaces for building community among survivors navigating the aftermath of sexual violence. She explained that ""being online and being able to read other survivor accounts and look at resources and still being able to maintain that control and separation of how much you want to reveal"" was important. She continued by explaining that online, ""You don't have to tell your story . . . in order to read someone else's,"" as opposed to going to a support group or counselor where one needs to share their story in order to hear someone else's, which some survivors may not be ready to do. We observed this through several of the hashtag conversations on Twitter. For example, #survivorprivilege began shortl",6451,7376
10.1177/2056305120984447,,Madden and Alt 2021,True,Stephanie Madden,Know Her Name: Open Dialogue on Social Media as a Form of Innovative Justice,"
Innovative justice focuses on crime victim needs, support, and healing outside of criminal justice systems. We use the recent public coming forward of Chanel Miller-the survivor in the Brock Turner case-to interrogate innovative justice for sexual assault survivors on social media. By qualitatively analyzing Miller's Instagram account, we found that it was a platform for innovative justice by being a visual space to process emotions, modeling growth and healing, and offering validation and hope. We offer the concept of victim-centered public dialogue (VCPD), which allows for the public witnessing and possibility for personal disclosures in online spaces that contribute to a process of growth and healing for survivors.
",2021-01,Social Media + Society,SAGE Publications,"
In March 2016, Brock Turner was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman (known as ""Emily Doe"") at a fraternity party in January 2015 at Stanford University (Miller, 2016). For this crime, Turner faced up to 14 years in prison. However, Judge Aaron Persky sentenced Turner to a mere 6 months in jail (of which he served three) and 3 years' probation due to concerns that a harsher punishment would have a ""severe impact"" on Turner (Stack, 2016, para. 4). Such light sentencing drew public outrage from prosecutors and advocates, as well as fury from social media users (Stack, 2016). This outrage led to a campaign to recall Judge Persky, which required a massive petition campaign to get signatures from registered voters for the issue to be put on the ballot (""Stanford Sex Attack,"" 2018). In June 2018, Judge Persky was recalled from office; the first judge to be removed from office in this way in more than 80 years in California. While the court of public opinion provided some form of justice in this case, going through formal criminal justice channels for crimes of sexual violence is continually fraught with challenges, from retraumatizing victims to light sentencing for perpetrators (Fileborn, 2017). In this way, ""'justice' continues to elude the vast majority of rape victim-survivors"" (Powell, 2015, p. 573).
Justice, though, can be conceptualized in ways that do not rely on criminal or retributive systems. Instead, systems of innovative justice focus on the needs of the survivor to heal (Daly, 2016). Recently, Chanel Miller (""Emily Doe"") came forward with a call for people to know her name through the announcement of her memoir, Know My Name (de LeÃ³n, 2019). By qualitatively analyzing Miller's Instagram account, we offer an example of how this visual and textual platform allows survivors to engage in open dialogue around the issue of sexual assault that can serve as a form of innovative justice.
Literature Review
We begin by discussing the various consequences of harm for sexual assault survivors to contextualize why current criminal justice efforts are not enough. Then, we introduce restorative justice (RJ), and the umbrella concept of innovative justice, as a process that seeks to repair harm in its varied forms. Next, we consider how innovative justice has been enacted in online spaces and conceptual differences that exist between it and online activism. Finally, we explore the concept of open dialogue through social media.
Consequences of Harm for Sexual Assault Survivors
A key concern when it comes to the concepts of justice, restoration, and healing is the harm itself: its nature, various manifestations, and long-term consequences. Following Wasco (2003), we conceptualize harm in the context of sexual assault as (1) not caused by the/a specific traumatic event alone and (2) not solely evidenced by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, which are traditionally understood as feelings of fear, horror, and threat to life. First, sexual assault is a process that involves, in addition to trying to survive the assault, negotiating post-assault experiences such as how to cope, who to disclose to, and how to seek help (Konradi, 1996). The process of sexual assault also involves ""society's responses to the assault, which often absolve the perpetrator of blame"" and retraumatize victims (Wasco, 2003, p. 312). Thus, harm is associated with the specific cultural, social, and relational context in which sexual violence usually occurs (Wasco, 2003).
Second, posttraumatic stress symptoms may only be a fraction of the harm caused by sexual assault or rape (Wasco, 2003). For example, the violation of trust that accompanies sexual assault, ""whether through blatant violent attack or subtle coercion"" (Wasco, 2003, p. 317), has significant consequences for a survivor's future relationships. Furthermore, survivors often internalize a sense of worthlessness and experience ""feelings of intense shame or even as a distortion of reality"" (Wasco, 2003, p. 317). Substance abuse, disordered eating, and suicidal feelings are also common for sexual assault survivors (Campbell et al., 2009;Dworkin et al., 2017). Therefore, ""framing an offense primarily as a violation of the law minimizes the emotional, relational, and moral harm suffered"" (Paul & Borton, 2017, p. 201). Because of this expanded recognition of the consequences of harm, sexual assault survivors may find the criminal justice system inadequate for helping them heal.
From RJ to Innovative Justice
RJ may be viewed as a movement or efforts to transform the current processes and outcomes in criminal justice. Through RJ approaches, the offense or harm is addressed through dialogue. In particular, Victim-Offender Conferences (VOC) bring together victims, offenders, and their supporters to discuss the harm, potential reparations, and any future relationship the involved parties may wish to have (Paul, 2016;Paul & Dunlop, 2014;Umbreit, 2001). Communication and growth are at the heart of RJ approaches, and VOC facilitators assert that these conferences ""foster greater sensitivity, growth, and involvement for all parties than do conventional trials alone"" (Paul, 2016, p. 251). VOC engage in what Levad (2012) conceptualizes as ethical discernment, which entails empathizing with others, locating specific incidents within broader contexts, considering situational particularities for survivors, and seeing possibilities outside of the strict limitations of the legal codes.
VOC facilitators view justice outcomes as multilayered and not mutually exclusive. Justice can be understood as offender punishment, personal repair, and/or relationship rebalancing (Paul & Dunlop, 2014). While offender punishment is the most traditional outcome, results associated with justice as personal repair included healing, story completion, and closure for both victim and offender. Relational balancing involves the literal ""(re)creation [or restoration] of relationship peace among victims, offenders, and involved communities"" (Paul & Dunlop, 2014, p. 270). Another dimension, justice as human growth, cuts across these three layers (Paul & Dunlop, 2014). Justice as human growth predominately defines growth as understanding resulting from face-to-face dialogue; offenders gain a greater knowledge about the consequences of their actions and survivors gain insight into crimes committed against them (Brooks, 2017).
In defining a tangible measure of healing, McCauley et al. ( 2019) argued that we must move beyond just considering the ""absence of depression, anxiety, and PTSD"" and instead look for the ""presence of survivor-defined outcomes. A focus on posttraumatic growth and thriving should be the minimum standard we hold for successful interventions with survivors"" (p. 1918, emphasis added). Seeking this presence of growth and thriving relies on what Levad (2012) calls ""moral imagination,"" or the ""cognitive faculty that empowers human beings to create images of our world and its possibilities"" (p. 70). Cultivating moral imagination enables human beings to consider a variety of images of both the world as it is and possibilities for what it could become.
From a conceptual standpoint, Daly (2016) argues that RJ is not the most precise framing for these justice mechanisms. Rather, a more apt term to describe these activities is ""innovative justice,"" which serves as a broader umbrella concept rather than a specific type of justice (Daly, 2016). Several innovative justice mechanisms fall under this umbrella beyond a VOC, including people's tribunals, truth-telling or truth-seeking mechanisms, cultural performances, days of remembrance, and other art and activist projects (Daly, 2016). Innovative justice ""may be part of the criminal justice system, work alongside it, or be independent of it"" (Daly, 2011, p. 9). Such framing also addresses concerns that expected outcomes could only (or mainly) be ""restoration"" or ""reconciliation"" in traditional RJ approaches (Daly, 2016, p. 21). This is a concern because in some cases restoration or reconciliation is not appropriate or in the victim's best interests. However, through an innovative justice framework a variety of outcomes can meet the needs of victims/survivors. Beyond a face-to-face dialogue traditionally associated with RJ, other mechanisms, such as victim impact statements, may enable survivors to experience ""social acknowledgment, a sense of control, an opportunity to tell [their] story, not having to continually relive the crime, and not being required to confront a perpetrator directly"" (Herman, 2005, p. 574). Social media may also serve as a platform for these restorative outcomes. In this paper, we will utilize the more encompassing term of innovative justice to encapsulate alternative forms of justice. In the next section, we explore scholarship regarding the potential of online spaces as sites for innovative justice.
Innovative Justice in Online Spaces Herring et al. (2002) argued that online forums appeal to vulnerable publics seeking support such as ""members of minority, social and political groups"" (p. 371). These virtual spaces are appealing to victims of inequality as they can coexist in a space that acknowledges their pain and isolation (Dixon, 2014). For survivors of sexual violence, Powell (2015) argued that such online engagements ""represent more than a resistive politics, but the development of new technosocial practices of informal justice"" (p. 580). For example, hashtag feminism (e.g., #MeToo) has become a popular tool for survivors of sexual assault to share their stories (Mendes et al., 2018;Turley & Fisher, 2018). While there may be an overlap between online feminist action and innovative justice online in terms of voicing experiences and reclaiming a narrative, these terms are not interchangeable (Powell, 2015). Disclosing personal stories and shared experiences is not only part of a collective political practice but can play an important role for individual feelings of justice when acknowledged by a trusted audience (Powell, 2015). Importantly, while focusing on the innovative justice potential of online spaces, we also recognize how online technologies ""have been used to extend the harm of sexual violence through further harassing, humiliating, shaming and blaming victim-survivors"" (Powell, 2015, p. 579). However, in this paper, we are focusing on more positive aspects of online spaces for survivor disclosure and community building.
Online spaces are increasingly becoming ""spaces where victim/survivors' justice needs can to some extent be met"" (Fileborn, 2017(Fileborn, , p. 1483)). Furthermore, ""[j]ustice can be a collective, rather than individual, pursuit"" (Fileborn, 2017(Fileborn, , p. 1485)). Online community building for victim/survivors can contribute to the validation of the experience and recognition that the offender's actions were wrong (Clark, 2015). Gundersen and Zaleski (2020) found that self-identified sexual assault survivors who shared their experiences online ""found relief, shared commonality, and advocacy-or even protection-from others when disclosing their narrative on social media, as well as in the responses they received"" (p. 9). Digital discourse provides a platform to explicitly challenge survivor feelings of shame and self-blame through the support in the responses to the disclosure (Gundersen & Zaleski, 2020). Ultimately, disclosing sexual assault narratives online may contribute to psychological wellness (Gundersen & Zaleski, 2020). These disclosures benefit the survivor and may help to create an opportunity for greater dialogue surrounding stigmatized issues both online and offline.
Social Media as a Site for Open Dialogue
Scholars have increasingly looked at the way that survivors are using social media and other digital technologies to dialogue, network, and organize against rape culture (Mendes et al., 2018). Yet, the concept of dialogue is often used without explication or analysis in such studies. In addition, because dialogue forms the core of so many approaches to restorative justice, we want to further understand the concept of dialogue within innovative justice-rather than simply online feminist activism-as it is enacted on social media.
Dialogue, while an attractive ideal toward which to strive, is difficult to operationalize in practice (Theunissen & Noordin, 2012). Furthermore, dialogic theory has evolved beyond interpersonal communication to also encompass communication with organizations. Because of this, public relations research has taken the lead in helping to unpack the relationship between dialogue and social media (e.g., Briones et al., 2011;Henderson & Bowley, 2010;Taylor et al., 2001). Although Chanel Miller is an individual and not an organization, we argue that her new status as a public figure and public social media presence means that public relations conceptualizations of dialogue are useful for this study (Watkins, 2017).
To better operationalize dialogue in a public relations context, Kent and Taylor (2002) argued that there are five key features of dialogue: (1) mutuality-a collaborative orientation and mutual equality for participants; (2) propinquityconsulting publics on issues that influence them and a willingness by publics to articulate demands; (3) empathyclimate of supportiveness and trust; (4) risk-potential for vulnerability and unanticipated consequences; and (5) commitment-marked by honesty and forthrightness and working toward a common understanding. This focus on empathy and risk seems like a natural starting point for understanding if Kent and Taylor's (2002) view of dialogue can be useful for exploring issues of innovative justice for sexual assault survivors, particularly in the very public approach taken by Chanel Miller.
Yet, an immediate challenge to considering Kent and Taylor's (2002) operationalization of dialogue is that it focuses too much on dyadic relationships, that is, organization-public (Capizzo, 2018). By only considering dyadic relationships, it appears that there is no dialogue occurring on Miller's Instagram page as she follows zero people and does not directly engage with any of the comments. Furthermore, there is also little to no interaction between commenters on this page. It can be easy to dismiss the idea of dialogue in this social media space, especially for a deeply personal and still stigmatized issue like sexual assault (Madden, 2019). However, removing the need for a dyadic relationship and embracing the concept of open dialogue provides opportunities to reconsider what constitutes dialogue in the socially mediated public sphere.
Open dialogue is rooted in a Bahktinian approach to dialogue, which is largely public and addresses visible conversations (Capizzo, 2018). Not only can people participate in open dialogue, but they can also witness discussions (Heath, 2000). Capizzo (2018) argued that open dialogue can link dialogic approaches to the public sphere. Habermas (1989) defined the public sphere as ""the sphere of private people come together as a public"" (p. 27). Despite claiming accessibility for all, Habermas' conceptualization of the public sphere rested on exclusions (Fraser, 1992). Women, the uneducated, the minoritized, and the poor were excluded from the historical public sphere, and masculine gender constructs were viewed as rational, with new gender norms relegating women to the private, domestic sphere versus the public sphere (Fraser, 1992). Allowing for the inclusion of emotional, oftentimes traumatic, topics such as sexual assault into public venues like social media allows for the ""presence and promise of cultural formations that bring traumatic histories into the public sphere and use accounts of affective experience to transform our sense of what constitutes a public sphere"" (Cvetkovich, 2003, pp. 15-16). Part of the healing process for survivors of sexual violence can come by using written disclosure (Burke & Bradley, 2006). Furthermore, the idea of witnessing as part of dialogue is related to validation of the experience (Clark, 2015). This broader understanding of dialogue provides utility when thinking about conversations surrounding sexual violence that happen on social media and their inclusion in the public sphere.
In addition, Madden (2018) argued for dialogue to go beyond the words themselves, particularly for emotional and gendered issues like sexual assault. Images and creative expression can become an important part of dialogue, and ""alternative forms of engagement are also capable [of] tapping into shared emotions to build a climate of supportiveness"" (Madden, 2018, p. 306). Such forms of creative expression may also be part of the healing process for innovative justice. In the spirit of expanding conceptualizations of dialogue for issues of sexual violence, we believe the concept of open dialogue provides additional opportunities for understanding innovative justice. With this in mind, we pose the following research question: RQ: How, if at all, can social media serve as a platform for innovative justice through facilitating open dialogue around sexual assault?
Methods
We selected Chanel Miller's Instagram account (@ chanelmillerknowmyname) for analysis because it is the only social media site in which she is posting content as a public figure. The creation of this Instagram account coincided with the launch of her memoir on September 23, 2019 (Flock, 2019), meaning that followers had access to her book at the same time posts began. Her Instagram account is comprised of images she drew as a way to process the trauma she endured as a rape survivor, as well as her newfound success as a writer and artist. Because of Instagram's focus on the visual, we believe it is an important site to explore the alternative forms of engaging in dialogue related to sexual violence (Madden, 2018). Furthermore, while Instagram is also the fastest growing social network site globally (Sheldon & Bryant, 2016), it is one of the most understudied social media platforms (Guidry et al., 2014).
Our data set was comprised of nine Instagram posts Miller made between September 24 and October 10, 2019. We also included the 1,189 comments that people made in response to the posts. Although all comments were made on a public account, we have decided not to report any usernames.
Because of the sensitive nature of the topic and varying degree of personal disclosures occurring in this space, we want to give people the maximum degree of anonymity possible. Table 1 in Appendix A provides more detailed information about each post analyzed and the number of comments.
Data Analysis
We used a combination of Braun and Clarke's (2006) thematic analysis process and an iconographic qualitative approach (MÃ¼ller, 2011;MÃ¼ller & Ã–zcan, 2007) to identify patterns and themes in both the visual and textual data. We began familiarizing ourselves with the content by looking at the images and reading through the comments written on each post. We then split up the data set, with one researcher deeply analyzing the visual images and developing initial codes for the September 24 to October 4 posts and comments and the other researcher doing the same for October 5 to October 10. After discussing the initial codes and interpretations of the data, we collapsed the initial codes into broader themes and found representative quotes. We engaged in extensive peer debriefing throughout the data analysis process through email and by phone. Finally, we reviewed and decided on the final themes, which are recorded in the next section.
Results
Three primary themes emerged in the usage of Chanel Miller's Instagram as a platform for innovative justice, which were a visual space to process emotions, modeling growth and healing, and validation and hope. With each of these three themes, open dialogue around sexual assault is facilitated through the act of public witnessing and disclosures from others.
A Visual Space to Process Emotions
Because Instagram is primarily a visual social media platform, Miller frequently posts her original artwork-often involving cartoon creatures-to explain complicated emotional processing. In the October 5 post, Miller's first drawing in this post shares an anecdote about seeing a mother comfort her crying baby. The mother asks, ""do you need UP?"" Seeing this made Miller think about ""how many people reading my book are moved, but also processing a lot"" and she wants ""to be able to hold them up."" She then visualizes a forest full of ""soft sleeping monsters"" that someone could call upon to find them (the monsters have tissue boxes for hats) while they read to hold them up. Similarly, the October 7 post depicted six pigs, all of which are supporting a girl (presumably Miller) through words or physical actions (hugging, holding). Captions from the pigs read: ""Don't cry""; ""We've got you""; ""You're okay""; ""Stay calm""; ""We're here""; ""It will be fine""; and ""I promise."" The caption on this post reads, ""I drew these little in April 2015 when I was extra sad and wobbly. As long as I have a pen, I can always conjure creatures to comfort me. ï€¡""
The use of these creatures to explain emotions created opportunities for the use of emojis as shorthand. The September 30 post was about depression, with slugs symbolizing the slow pace and sluggishness experienced when depressed and horses symbolizing the idea that ""everyone is charging forward."" The caption for this post read ""I drew this comic last year while writing, after making peace with the knowing that I'll always be riding both slugs and horses. âœðŸ¼ ðŸŒðŸŽðŸ“šâœ¨."" Emojis are used prominently in other posts as well and are sometimes the entire caption of a post. Using her cartoon creatures and animals to represent emotions facilitates the usage of emojis as shorthand for issues that are difficult to put into words.
Because this account was created in direct connection with the release of Miller's memoir, many of the people commenting are not directly responding to the images being posted but are using the platform to respond to the book. Many followers remarked on processing their own emotions while reading (or listening to) Miller's book. One follower noted, ""I'm listening and have to pause over and over again but your sharing brings me so much healing through processing-emotions I thought were long gone. Thank you for your courage, advocacy and compassion ."" Similarly, another person commented, ""I've been crying on and off all morning listening to your audiobook. Lots to process. Thank you ."" Another follower described ""needing to take emotional breaks"" while reading the book and that they ""100% could use a monster"" (referencing the tissue monster drawing from the post). Someone else described a similar experience of needing to stop and just cry when listening to the audiobook. But this emotional release helped them feel ""a little lighter, just like I do when I paint or write. I realize more now that I can't just keep it to myself because me too."" In line with this, several followers called for Miller to write a children's book, using her drawings to help talk about complicated topics with children and begin teaching consent at a relatively young age.
Although many of the details are left vague, one follower indicates they are also going through a sexual assault trial and Miller's book and Instagram account helped them process the emotions around this: I am so moved and inspired by your cartoon skits, words of encouragement and of course your book! I am still working through it and can identify with so many of your thoughts, feelings and reactions. Your book was released on the same day the closing arguments in my court case took place . . . Your book helped pick me up that day to comfort me and many days after too. Thank you for spreading your message and empowering all of our voices â¤ðŸ’ª #metoo #knowmynamechanelmiller #chanelmiller #passedoutisnotconsent
Modeling Growth and Healing
In the same way images help to explain complicated emotions, Miller also uses her drawings to discuss her own personal growth and healing from her assault to more broadly model healing as a non-linear path. In the October 10 post, Miller explains this using drawings of a boat on open water. Everyone is on their own boat making their way safely through the ocean. Making a change (in this case switching boats and the in between of being in the water) is hard to do without some sort of external reason: a better job, another boy, a better apartment. The boat we are on is safe, and it is unclear whether a new boat will work out the way we think it will. As one follower said, ""This is amazing and relatable and so true. Thank you for sharing what helps heal you with all of us so we can learn and heal and grow, too ."" Similarly, someone else said ""all your posts make me cry in the best way. thank you for sharing yourself with us. it's helping me in my own healing ."" Others describe having feelings stirred up that ""we might have buried."" A further indication of how strongly people feel this book can help survivors on the path toward healing comes from the comment by a therapist, who said, Hell yeah. Just finished the book and in some weird way, I'm actually sad I'm done with it. Just so freaking good. You did such a beautiful job but more than that, you spoke your truth and gave power to yourself and so many others through your words. I feel so honored I got to read it and now get to share it with my friends and family and even my clients (therapist here. ðŸ˜Š) Bravo!! Many followers also indicated being inspired by Miller's story and her resilience. For example, one follower wrote, ""I love your art and writing. You're incredibly talented. I love how you have used your pain to strengthen yourself and those around you. You're an inspiration â™¥."" Another follower commented that ""You've proven that people survive WHILE hurting and that's okay.""
Validation and Hope
The first post on Miller's Instagram page is a short video she made of her experiences as an assault survivor. This video includes Miller drawing characters like those that are in her other Instagram postings, but in this video they are Miller provides a voice over to go along with the images. In only 4 min, Miller talks about her experiences being assaulted, going on trial, and finding an online community of support. In the video, Miller explains that ""when you are assaulted, an identity is given to you. It threatens to swallow up everything you plan to do and be."" In one of the animated images, you can see Miller curled up in a blanket reading posts about the assault on her phone. As other people's comments surround her, her voiceover says ""shame, really, can kill you."" As she is walking with her head down in the next image, the words ""unconscious,"" ""stupid,"" ""swimmer,"" ""dumpster,"" ""Stanford,"" ""half naked,"" ""nameless,"" and ""nobody"" surround her. As the word ""nobody"" fades, Miller says ""Nobody wants to be defined by the worst thing that's happened to them.""
As the introduction explained, one of the notable outcomes from Miller's trial was the light sentencing given to Brock Turner. Miller addresses her experiences in court in this video as well, noting that ""In court, the judge used words like 'moderate, less serious' to describe the crime."" Miller also talks about the victim blaming she experienced in court, with the defense attorney saying ""Chanel knows how you get in blackouts. You drink a lot of alcohol and that's what she did that night and many other nights, to be honest.""
The experiences described by Miller are typical for survivors of sexual assault. To confront the idea that this was a less serious crime, or that she was at fault, Miller wrote a 12-page victim impact statement that she read at the sentencing ""straight to the man who hurt me."" Portions of the victim impact statement are read in this video, which include Miller describing being ""irreversibly hurt"" and ""waiting to figure out if I was worth something."" The next animation includes the figure of the judge taking off headphones after she spoke, and Miller saying, ""but the judge did not hear me"" as Turner only received a 6-month sentence. When Miller released the statement online, though, ""something else happened. The world breathed life into my words. I spent all this time absorbing, listening to their voices, until I understood."" It was from this online encouragement and support that Miller realized her talents of writing and illustrating could serve a larger purpose.
Because of the vulnerability and authenticity expressed by Miller in her experiences as a survivor of sexual assault, many people in the comments shared how Miller's story resonated with them and gave them hope. One follower responded to this video post by saying, ""I cry at your artwork and writing because they are so touching and really understand how I as a survivor feel. This one touched my heart."" Similarly, another follower wrote Well, this made me cry. You are Soooooo strong (stronger than anyone should ever need to be). But also strong enough to be open, and soft and share & that's amazing. And what makes change. Thank you so much for speaking up and helping reclaim the narrative for survivors.
In addition, having Miller put her story out there in multiple formats and talking about her trauma in various ways offered validation for survivors. A comment on the October 5 post encapsulates this well:
Your book IS that soft sleeping monster-comforting and lifting us all up with your strength and courage. Your words spoke truth to my experience even though our stories were not identical. I couldn't get through a chapter without crying, but those tears were washing something away. Knowing that you have spoken truth to what so many of us have been through and that you put it so beautifully and clearly and eloquently gave me so much hope. I was so filled with love for you and for every survivor out there and for every woman who showed me compassion like you describe.
Similarly, another follower wrote ""Thank you for your book. You show how much hope can be found in tragedy and trauma. One of these days, I hope I can find it too. 5 years later and I'm still searching.""
Discussion
The overarching research question for this project asked how social media could serve as a platform for innovative justice through facilitating open dialogue around sexual assault. From her first Instagram post, Miller directly addresses the way in which criminal justice approaches to sexual assault failed her by focusing more on the harm to Brock Turner's future rather than the harm done to her by his actions (Wasco, 2003). Even though Turner went to trial and was convicted, Miller was still exposed to victim blaming and re-traumatization as part of the criminal justice process-a common occurrence for survivors (Wasco, 2003). Because of the failing of the criminal justice system to address growth and healing for survivors, we argue that Miller utilizes art and writing as part of her healing process as a form of innovative justice (Daly, 2016). By writing this book and creating this social media account, she is not only reclaiming her narrative but reclaiming the public dialogue around her story.
Because of the focus visuals, this case further extends the need to consider dialogue beyond words (Madden, 2018). Through visual metaphor, Miller's art creates tangible ways to describe intangible emotions by portraying something as some other thing (Birdsell & Groarke, 2007;Lazard et al., 2016). In this way, Miller demonstrates Levad's (2012) principle of moral imagination through her illustrations, as both she and her followers and/or commenters created and engaged with ""images of our world and its possibilities"" (p. 201). By illustrating creatures to represent difficult and dark feelings, people can begin to interrogate any buried thoughts and emotions. Emojis figured prominently into both Millers' posts and people's responses to the posts, which either comprised the entire response or were integrated with text. Although emojis are often light-hearted (Stark & Crawford, 2015), in this case emojis served a deeper bonding and emotional function. As Stark and Crawford (2015) argued, emojis can be understood as social expression and actual emotional feeling. The heart emoji was prominently used, indicating support and creating ""new avenues for digital feeling"" (Stark & Crawford, 2015, p. 1).
Miller's open discussion of emotional and traumatic topics on a public social media account helps to destigmatize topics once deemed private and personal and allows for them to be included in the publi",6754,7629
10.1007/978-3-319-93372-6_13,,,False,Lydia Manikonda,#metoo Through the Lens of Social Media,"
Sexual abuse -a highly stigmatized topic in the society has spurred a revolution in the recent days especially through the shared posts on social media platforms via attaching the hashtag #metoo. Individuals from different backgrounds and ethnicities began sharing on the online venues about their personal experiences of getting sexually assaulted. This paper makes an initial attempt to asses the public reactions and emotions by utilizing the publicly shared #metoo posts by performing a comparative analysis of the tweets shared on Twitter as well as on Reddit. Though nearly equal ratios of negative and positive posts are shared on both platforms, Reddit posts are focused on the sexual assaults within families and workplaces while Twitter posts are on showing empathy and encouraging others to continue the #metoo movement. The data collected in this research helps in the preliminary analysis of the user engagement, discussion topics, word connotations and sentiment with respect to the #metoo movement.1 Although the term #metoo was originally coined in 2006 by social activists to raise awareness about sexual abuse, it became viral in October 2017, following the alleged sexual misconduct in the Hollywood.
",2018,J. Mach. Learn. Res,Springer International Publishing,"Introduction
Sexual abuse has been traditionally buried due to the fear of shame, retribution and retaliation. Sexual abuse, and abuse in general is a very difficult topic for individuals to talk about, irrespective of an online or an offline setting [9,10]. In United States itself, on an average there are 321,500 victims (age 12 or older) of rape and sexual assault each year where, ages 12-34 are the highest risk years. The trauma of the sexual abuse has resulted in the long-term negative impacts such as anxiety, suicidal behavior, PTSD, panic disorder, mood and behavioral disorder problems [3].
This Stigmatized topic -sexual abuse, has gained a lot of attention recently especially with individuals self-disclosing their personal experiences on online social media platforms. While many personal stories have gained attention from the media and general public as the #metoo movement 1 where, most of the reports that gained attention were only the experiences of few people. With the online venues enabling individuals to maintain privacy and to self-disclose their true feelings [5][6][7][8], numerous individuals joined this movement through sharing their personal experiences and opinions about sexual abuse. The shared posts include different types of experiences related to sexual abuse as well as the opinions about how to bring awareness in the society to combat such issues. It is not very clear what the individuals are sharing through these posts as majority of the media coverages are about few individuals who are popular. Through a comparative analysis of posts shared on Twitter and Reddit, this paper provides a preliminary analysis on the demographics, user engagement, discussion topics, word connotations and sentiment.
Data
We obtained two sets of data from Twitter and Reddit using their corresponding python APIs -https://goo.gl/P6GoFy and https://goo.gl/F3981i respectively. We collect 620,348 posts from 205,489 users on Twitter and 190 posts from 70 users on Reddit. On Twitter, we crawl the public posts (from October 2017 to January 2018) that are attached with the #metoo hashtag where as for Reddit, we crawl all the self posts shared on /r/metoo subreddit. The data includes all the meta-data associated with the post. Due to the sensitivity of the topic and specifically the viral nature of the #metoo hashtag, we first want to investigate how the tweets shared on this topic engage other users on Twitter. We compute statistics about the engagement attributes that include -number of favorites these tweets received, number of times a tweet is retweeted, number of mentions in the tweets and the number of hashtags attached to these tweets. Table 1 shows that on an average these tweets receive atleast 5 favorites and 2 retweets which is relatively more engaging compared to general tweets [12]. This might be due to other users endorsing the tweets. On the other hand, it is surprising to see that users tend to engage in conversations with other users or atleast mention them more prominently.
Social Engagement
Figure 1 shows the log-log plot of these engagement attributes shedding light on the favorites and retweets received by these posts. All the engagement attributes follow a power-law distribution showing that there exist few posts which are very highly engaging relative to the majority of the remaining posts. Complementing these observations, Reddit posts which can receive both up votes and down votes, receive 2.26 up votes (standard deviation = 2.03) on an average. None of the self posts shared on #metoo subreddit received down votes suggesting that posts shared on Reddit are positively engaging. Since #metoo related posts are socially engaging, it is important to understand the content of these posts. We first extract the latent topics present in these posts and then focus on how users label sexual abuse through their vocabulary usage.
Linguistic Themes to Understand the Content

Latent Topic Extraction
We extract the latent topics from the corpus containing all the self posts shared on #metoo subreddit as well as the corpus of all posts attached with the #metoo hashtag on Twitter. Topic analysis helps us understand the aspects of sexual abuse that the individuals are focusing on the two platforms. We use LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic modeling technique [1] to extract the latent topics shown in Table 2.a and .b for Reddit and Twitter respectively.
On both these platforms, people share their experiences of getting assaulted (topic 0 in Reddit and topic 2 in Twitter). Users also encourage each other to be strong and fight against harassment by contributing to the movement (topic 2 in Reddit and topic 0 in Twitter). However, we notice two significant differences in the types of posts shared on Reddit and Twitter. On Reddit, survivors mainly share the details of the story (e.g. how and when that happened to them) and how they were hurt emotionally (topics 0, 1 and 3). They also mention the affiliation of offenders (topic 4). While On Twitter, people do not expose the details and mainly focus on supporting victims of sexual violence by just posting relevant hashtags (topic 2 summarizes the mostly used hashtag during the movement), sharing relevant news (topic 1 and 3) and urls of related news articles (topic 4). On Twitter, users share their stories of being harassed at workplace and how they fear being retaliated for complaining about the harassment (topic 0). These differences in terms of being descriptive between Reddit and Twitter might be because of the character limit enforced by these platforms. In particular, Reddit has allowed users to share more details and thus users might be able to reveal their true feelings easier than Twitter. But it is interesting to see that this movement became viral due to the posts shared on Twitterfoot_0 . To obtain a basic understanding of the content shared, we extract n-grams.
Labeling Sexual Abuse
Table 3 shows the bi-grams and uni-grams extracted from Twitter and Reddit posts. Bigrams show that majority of the Reddit posts focus on individual experiences about sexual harassment for example: years old, Im sorry, one day, etc., where as Twitter posts focus on the existing sexual assault stories and opinions about how to address these issues (metoo movement, say metoo, social media, etc.). Unigrams also highlight similar set of observations. Using the most frequently occurring keywords in these text corpuses, we dig a little deeper to understand how users label sexual abuse through the words associated with these keywords.
Considering Syntactic as Well as Semantic Relationships.
To ensure that both the syntactic and semantic relationships are captured, we represent the vocabulary of the corpus in a Word2Vec space and measure their similarities [4]. Through the pairwise word relationships shown in Table 4, the most frequently occurring keywords suggest that some of the terms such as men is associated with aggressive and violate certain aspects where as, woman is associated with humiliated publicly and intimidated. Whenever users mention their personal experiences (for example the term story), it is highly correlated with words such as heartbreaking, frightening, terrifying, horrifying, awful, etc. Alongside, most of the other keywords (such as sex, rape, victims, etc. ) are similarly associated with a vocabulary that is mostly negative. However, the users are also recognizing that these issues should be addressed immediately (see keyword timesup) and is slightly on an encouraging side compared to other keyword relationships. Words such as movement is co-occurring with words such as hysterical, nonsense and it is not very clear if users are mocking the #metoo movement that may require further analysis. Due to the limited set of posts crawled from Reddit, we didn't find any significant co-occurring patterns.
5 Individual Emotions Through Linguistic Markers We use psycholinguistic lexicon LIWC 3 to characterize and compare the type of emotions expressed on both the platforms. We obtain measures of the attributes related to user behavior: emotionality (how people are reacting that includes sad, anger, anxiety, positive and negative emotions), social relationships (family), and individual differences (work, bio, death, swear, sexual). For each attribute, we use the statistical t-test to check if the Twitter distribution is not significantly different from those of Reddit. Null hypothesis is rejected if p-value â‰¤ 0.05. Figure 2 shows that the distribution of insight, anger, work, swear and positive and negative emotions attributes in Twitter are significantly different from those of Reddit. In contrast, posts on both platforms have the same distribution for sadness and anxiety attributes.
Emotion Attributes

Sentiment Extraction
To measure the type of sentiment on both platforms, we use Vader [2] -a sentiment analysis tool designed specifically to extract sentiments from social media posts. Results are shown in Fig. 3 with the following observations. Reddit posts are generally more negative than Twitter posts. This might be because people have no limitation on their posts lengths and thus can easily share their feelings about their stories. However, few posts on Reddit express positive sentiment emphasizing to support the movement. Considering these platforms exclusively, the ratio of positive to negative posts on these platforms are equal to each other showcasing the presence of positivity towards the movement. 
Conclusions
In this paper, we focus on the shared posts of users attached with the #metoo hashtag on these platforms (i.e. Reddit and Twitter). The insights obtained from this research reveal the fundamental differences in the behaviors of individuals on these two platforms. Some of the key findings are: (1) users share their personal stories in details on Reddit while on Twitter, they tend to pursue other users to continue the #metoo movement; (2) Reddit posts are more negative while positive posts on Twitter showcase the presence of positivity towards the movement. These differences show that Twitter is a venue for sparking the movement while Reddit provides the chance for the people to share personal moments. We hope that our findings shed light on the important aspects associated with the sexual abuse which could initiate discussions between the individuals in the society as well as researchers and lawmakers.",2025,2243

In this article, we argue that social media platforms like Tumblr and Twitter have facilitated an emergence of ""digitized narratives"" of sexual violence. These narratives are rooted in historical ways in which feminists have discursively articulated sexual violence, yet are shaped by distinctive ""platform vernacular"" or the conventions, affordances, and restrictions of the platforms in which they appear. Drawing on a qualitative content and critical discourse analysis of 450 texts from the Tumblr site Who Needs Feminism? and the hashtag #BeenRapedNeverReported, we argue that digital platforms such as Tumblr and Twitter produce new vernacular practices which shape how ""digitized narratives"" of sexual violence are not only disclosed and known, but felt and experienced across digital networks.
",2018-12-29,New Media & Society,SAGE Publications,"Introduction
In 2012, 16 students enrolled in the ""Women in the Public Sphere"" course at Duke University designed a class assignment titled Who Needs Feminism? which sought to problematize the negative associations with the word ""feminism."" Using the popular social networking site Tumblr, they encouraged fellow students to post photos of themselves with signs explaining why feminism continues to be relevant in contemporary society, challenging dominant postfeminist sensibilities found within media cultures suggesting feminism is outdated and no longer needed (Gill, 2007;McRobbie, 2009). Since the campaign began, there have been over 5000 submissions to the Tumblr site, and over 60 other educational institutions have launched their own Who Needs Feminism? campaigns and separate websites (Seidman, 2013), demonstrating a widespread desire to problematize narratives that feminism is redundant or passÃ©.
Two years later in 2014, the #BeenRapedNeverReported hashtag began to trend on Twitter after allegations broke within the Canadian news media of sexual violence by prominent radio host Jian Ghomeshi (see also Keller et al., 2018;Mendes et al., 2019). The hashtag, started by two female Canadian journalists, was a public response to those who suggested Ghomeshi's accusers were lying because they had not previously reported their assaults to the police and served to document the myriad of reasons why victims do not report sexual violence. Many women (and some men) used the hashtag to share their own reasons for not reporting their assaults, creating an archive of 8 million tweets that document the prevalence of sexual violence.
Who Needs Feminism? and #BeenRapedNeverReported are just two examples of the ways the public increasingly use technology in creative ways to make visible, challenge, and call out sexual violence. Drawing from a qualitative content analysis and critical discourse analysis (CDA) of 450 texts, we argue that social media platforms like Tumblr and Twitter have facilitated an emergence of ""digitized narratives"" of sexual violence. These narratives draw on the ways in which feminists have discursively articulated sexual violence, extending them into digital spaces that are governed by distinctive ""platform vernaculars"" (Gibbs et al., 2015), or the conventions, affordances, and restrictions of the platforms in which they appear. This article then addresses two primary research questions: how are digitized narratives of sexual violence articulated on Tumblr and Twitter? and What types of affects are produced through these digital disclosures?
Platform vernaculars and sexual scripts
For several decades, feminist scholars have been interested in the narrative accounts of sexual violence in court cases, media, autobiographical accounts, and interviews (see Doherty and Anderson, 1998;Gunnarsson, 2018;Karlsson, 2019;Loney-Howes, 2018;O'Neil, 2018;Spry, 1995;Wood and Rennie, 1994). According to Young and McGuire (2003), the way people discuss sexually violent experiences is important because it shapes how they make sense of their assault. As a result, scholars have attended to the use of language and narrative accounts of violence, paying attention to the ways many victims have been unable to speak about their experiences, or had them invalidated during disclosures (Kelly and Radford, 1990). While this work provides important insights into how victims construct experiences of sexual violence and therefore shape what we know about it, the emergence of digital technologies opens new ways of communicating, disclosing, and narrating previously invisible experiences, emotions, and affects.
As part of the increased visibility of feminist activism in recent years, there has come a renewed focus on combatting sexual violence. In particular, digital campaigns have emerged to not only challenge sexual violence, but give victims a voice and provide them alternative forms of justice (see Drueke and Zobl, 2016;Fileborn, 2017;Loney-Howes, 2018;Olson, 2016;Powell, 2015;Salter, 2013;WÃ¥nggren, 2016;Wood et al., 2018). Many of these initiatives rely on sharing personal testimonials of violence, and scholars have begun to study the ways disclosures of violence are shared in digital spaces using digital devices and apps (see Bivens and Hasinoff, 2018;Dodge, 2016;Fileborn, 2019;Loney-Howes, 2015, 2018;Mendes et al., 2019;O'Neil, 2018). Bianca Fileborn (2019) argues that disclosure of sexual violence must be understood as a ""curated"" process in which careful decisions are made about whom to disclose, which experiences to share, and how narratives should be shaped. Others have identified how digitally curated disclosures hold the capacity to challenge victim-blaming narratives and female responsibilization of violence, making way for new narratives to emerge (Loney-Howes, 2018;Salter, 2013).
Although scholars are increasingly attending to narratives of sexual violence in digital spaces, few have theorized the particular narrative forms that circulate online, nor the technological, cultural, and material factors shaping them. This article aims to address this gap in research by considering how the ""platform vernacular"" (Gibbs et al., 2015) of Tumblr and Twitter shape the ways in which sexual violence is discursively produced. Platform vernacular refers to the ways each social media platform develops its own ""unique combination of styles, grammars, and logics"" (Gibbs et al., 2015: 257), and for the purposes of our study, how narratives of sexual violence are told. Stylistic and visual elements also contribute to a platform's vernacular and are especially important given the visual orientation of platforms like Tumblr and Instagram. Thus, platform vernacular emerges from within social networks, where meaning and affective value are constituted and established through both use and context (Warfield, 2016: 3). This concept or the variant of ""digital vernacular"" has been used by a range of scholars studying digital social practices (see Cho, 2015;Kanai, 2016;Mendes et al., 2019;Warfield, 2016). We find it a useful way to consider how ""group communication and grammar emerges on social media platforms"" to highlight the ways in which digital platforms are simultaneously governed by social norms, conventions, and practices in addition to technological constraints (Warfield, 2016: 3).
We are particularly interested in how platform vernaculars shape the affective experiences of engaging with sexual violence disclosures on Tumblr and Twitter. In other words, how do vernacular practices not only shape what we know about sexual violence but also how we come to know and feel these experiences? Our theoretical framework is informed by theories of ""networked affect"" (Hillis et al., 2015) which explore how the digital remediates and extends bodily capacities via connectivity, virality, and spread (boyd, 2010;Jenkins et al., 2012), and particularly how social media platforms enable new forms of affective relationality (Clough, 2018;Kuntsman, 2012;Mendes et al., 2019;Papacharissi, 2015;Sampson et al., 2018Wood et al., 2018). We consider how discourses (of sexual violence) emerge and are experienced affectively, considering their ""affective intensities"" (Ringrose and Renold, 2014) and variable 'stickiness'-in other words how they grab, attract, gain traction or not (Ahmed, 2004). We explore these affective aspects of digital connectivity as integral to understanding sexual violence in this contemporary moment.
In this article, we specifically consider how new sexual scripts or discourses (Simon and Gagnon, 1986) are emerging and developing in online spaces, creating new affective platform vernaculars (Mendes et al., 2019). Our article catalogs both digitized ""scripts of coercion"" (Bletzer and Koss, 2004) or the ""ways that a woman recognizes (either at the time that it happens or thereafter) that she has experienced an assault that may constitute rape"" (Bletzer and Koss, 2004: 115), as well as ""scripts of consent"" in which women ""negotiate and set boundaries within sexual relations"" (Bletzer and Koss, 2004: 115). As scholars have identified when it comes to narratives of sexual violence, scripts of coercion are shaped by many factors, such as cultural differences between women, time, and place (Bletzer and Koss, 2004;Ramos Lira et al., 1999). Adding to these arguments, we contend that scripts of coercion are ""curated"" (Fileborn, 2019) differently across digital platforms, shaped not only by the cultural, social, and personal (Simon and Gagnon, 1986) but also by affordances inherent in the platform architecture and the vernacular practices which develop in these online spaces.
The concepts of platform vernacular and scripts of coercion are useful because they attend to how architectural and social affordances produce different articulations of the experience of sexual violence. In this sense, we come to know sexual violence differently depending on the platform through which a narrative is mediated. The idea of platform vernacular also negates a technological deterministic argument by highlighting how social practices determine particular uses for platforms, within the limits of platform affordances.
For this article, we focus on two platforms: Twitter and Tumblr. Twitter is a popular social networking and microblogging site, which at the time of our study, allowed users to post 140-character updates or ""tweets"" to a network. With Twitter, there are also various ways to post messages, depending on the desired outcome. Users can attempt to draw attention to certain topics/events but prefacing them with a thematic hashtag (e.g. #BeenRapedNeverReported). These hashtags are searchable via the Twitter website and are said to ""trend"" when widely used, drawing more attention to the topic. One common vernacular on Twitter is to share hyperlinked content to other sites (boyd et al., 2010). In their analysis of over 720, 000 tweets, boyd et al. (2010) found that 22% contained a URL. This indicates that Twitter is not only used to provide brief ""news"" updates, but direct people to external sites which they can click through to get further information. This is often necessary given the character limit of the platform, which was only recently increased from 140 to 280 characters. Finally, it is worth highlighting how Twitter has become a central part of contemporary news media culture, often used by journalists to ""break news"" provide updates on rapidly evolving stories and interact with audiences, which can be done quickly on the platform. This is important in understanding Twitter as a digital tool that often hosts key conversations about current events, a point we will return to later in the article.
Who Needs Feminism? is hosted on the Tumblr platform and provides information for users such as how the campaign started, a link to submit a story and information for the public to start their own campaign. Tumblr is a microblogging site which ""curates"" diverse content produced by others ranging from pornography, fashion, blog entries, art, selfies poems, and protest. Tumblr prioritizes visual images which are aggregated among each Tumblr blog and circulate throughout the network via a process of re-blogging (Cho, 2015;Fink and Miller, 2014). As Alexander Cho (2015) has argued, Tumblr operates through affect, which ""reverb"" throughout the network, accruing intensity and movement through re-blogs and likes -an integral part of the Tumblr experience. Submissions to this site are presented in reverse chronological order, and each submission displays the number of ""notes"" which record the submission's circulation on the site, including the number of times it was commented upon, re-blogged, or ""liked"" (Fink and Miller, 2014;Renninger, 2015).
A typical Who Needs Feminism? submission has several hundred to several thousand notes, indicating the extent to which submissions forge ""sticky"" and emotional entanglements between contributors and readers (Ahmed, 2004), who share, like and re-blog content. Unlike other social media platforms such as Facebook, Tumblr blogs contain no personal profiles and are often anonymously authored. This is a key platform affordance in that the possibility of anonymity invites engagements, particularly when disclosing sensitive, private, or traumatic experiences. Consequently, Tumblr has become a particularly popular platform with marginalized groups, including people of color, queer communities, and those looking for digital spaces where they are ""safe"" to explore identities and ideas that may be unwelcome elsewhere (Cho, 2015;Fink and Miller, 2014;Renninger, 2015;Thelandersson, 2014;Warfield, 2016).
This article draws upon a systematic random sample of 150 posts from the Who Needs Feminism? Tumblr between March 2014 and January 2015. 1 Due to the sensitive nature of the topic and the importance of anonymity of contributors, we sought University ethics approval before beginning this project. Drawing from other studies of online disclosure of sexual violence, we have removed identifying information to preserve contributors' anonymity (see Andalibi et al., 2016;O'Neil, 2018). 2 To study the #BeenRapedNeverReported hashtag using a Python script, we scraped all tweets published between November 2014 and March 2015, the time in which the hashtag was most active. An algorithm was then developed to randomly select 300 tweets for further analysis.
Altogether, our sample for this article is a total of 450 pieces of digital data that were analyzed using qualitative content and CDA. Qualitative content analysis is useful for its ability to analyze large amounts of data, presenting it as simple frequencies (Bhattacherjee, 2012;Schreier, 2012). In addition to tabulating manifest content such as author, gender, or use of hashtags, qualitative content analysis records symbolic and latent content such as themes, frames, discourses, and tone (see Bhattacherjee, 2012). Despite its benefits, qualitative content analysis is incapable of analyzing systems of representations in text or speech (Deacon et al., 1999), which is why we use it in combination with CDA.
Following the tradition of CDA as developed by Norman Fairclough (1995), Teun van Dijk (1993), and Michelle Lazar (2005), which examine the relationship between language, social practice, ideology, gender, and power, we are interested in what experiences are (not) being recounted in each text, which details are (not) provided, and what impact the presence or absence of these disclosures have on the overall narrative accounts of assault. Unlike some work on networked affect (see Papacharissi, 2015), we are not taking a big data approach, but instead have drawn a relatively small sample size to enable a deeper qualitative analysis of texts. As a result, while we are hesitant to make generalized claims from our sample, it nonetheless provides us with some understanding of emerging trends and practices in relation to the ways narratives of sexual violence materialize and gain affective traction across digital spaces.
Who needs feminism? visuality, anonymity, and stylized affect
In this section, we address the ways in which disclosure of sexual violence is mediated through the vernacular practices common on the Tumblr campaign Who Needs Feminism? Given that the campaign is ostensibly about a much wider set of themes than sexual violence, we were surprised to see that in the random sample of 150 submissions from March 2014 to January 2015, a dominant subject was sexual violence, abuse, and harassment (41%). Thus, the campaign serves as a useful case study for our inquiry. In our analysis, we focus on the use of the handmade sign as a strategy that mobilizes the platform vernacular and affordances of Tumblr to orient particular affective reactions and ultimately, a sense of collective protest against sexual violence.
What is distinctive about the Who Needs Feminism? campaign is the creation of the handmade sign that is photographed and then uploaded to Tumblr. The signs function as the medium through which the personal testimonial is shared-often in handwritten or printed form. The use of signs is a pertinent example of the ways digitized narratives of sexual violence differ from conventional offline narratives found in interviews, court cases, or autobiographical accounts. The repetitive use of the handmade sign allows us to read the campaign as a meme, whereby a set of common expectations are established (Shifman, 2014). As part of Tumblr's visual meme culture, one of the main conventions defining this campaign is the use of what Amy Shield Dobson (2015) calls ""pain memes"" through which contributors' experiences of sexual violence are narrated through the visceral means of the hand-crafted sign, which makes use of different colors, size of print, bold, italics, and the underlining of key words. Following a long tradition of feminist craftivism (see Bain, 2016;Clarke, 2016;Kelly, 2014), Who Needs Feminism? pain memes demonstrate the artful potential of these modalities. The signs are material objects which have been digitally captured and transmitted to convey specific messages in particular ways (Rentschler and Thrift, 2015). We explore how the material and stylistic aspects of the signs, the texture, color, and embellishments create new forms of vernacular signage practices, initiating new forms of communicating experiences of sexual violence. We are therefore looking at the discursive, the material, and the affective in these practices of digital posting (Mendes et al., 2019).
Stylized affect through recounting the second-assault
A dominant narrative practice which emerged on Who Needs Feminism? is not just the recounting of the incident itself, but the significant critique of victim blaming, or not being taken seriously when confiding in, or reporting the assault to others. This ""secondassault"" is a well-known phenomenon which has been a central part of feminist theorizing on sexual violence (Wolburt Burgess et al., 2009), whereby the post-assault experience can be just as traumatic as the assault itself. This is because victims are routinely subjected to questioning about their appearance, behavior, lifestyle, or sexual past, as a way of transferring blame to them (Benedict, 1992;Bonnes, 2013;Herman, 2005;Meyer, 2010;Worthington, 2008). For example, as one contributor in Figure 1 stated,""I need feminism because my sister was raped and no one took her seriously.""
Stylistically, this image is typical within the sample and is striking in its use of a common ring-bound note pad, which we may associate with school-aged youth who would likely use this type of stationary in class. This is further accentuated by the careful retracing of words using red-colored felt tip pens to emphasize and accentuate key words. In terms of the narrative, although it is not clear to whom the sister reported her rape, the key lesson here was the way she was disbelieved, and thus discouraged from taking her claim forward. Although the sign in Figure 1 does not indicate the extent to which the sister was slut-shamed or victim-blamed, this was a common narrative in many other submissions, such as with Figure 2, where a young man shares his girlfriend's experience or reporting an attempted rape to the police.
This entry is unique because it is one of the few in which we can see the contributor's full face. Although this was a vernacular practice in early submissions to the project, over time, contributors began to either ""hide"" behind their sign (45% of total) or photograph only the sign itself (41% of total). A full view of the contributor's face was visible in only 20 submissions within our sample (14% of total), perhaps in response to the backlash and online abuse experienced by many contributors to this project (Mendes et al., 2019), but also as a means of providing a sense of anonymity as contributors shared highly personal and traumatic experiences.
Although we have blurred his face to protect his anonymity, the young man in Figure 2 sports a look of concern and seriousness in the photo. The fact the sign appears to have been ripped out of the notebook, and hastily written, with a mixture of capitalized letters adds to the material implications that his message is both urgent and alarming. The difficulty in reading the handwriting makes the accompanying typed out text below additionally important, as it ensures readers do not miss the message due to messy handwriting or poor photographic quality. The narrative presented here is important for directly challenging the police's victim-blaming and slut-shaming of his girlfriend who disbelieved her story because of how ""she presents herself.""
Because of hegemonic ideologies enforced by neoliberal frameworks, which condition women to take responsibility for guarding themselves against assault and accepting responsibility if assaulted (see Campbell, 2005;Loney-Howes, 2018;Moore, 2011;Stringer, 2014;Vera-Gray, 2018), it was not just the police who disbelieved victims, but family members as well. This is evident in Figure 3 which describes how a young woman's family dismissed her experiences of sexual violence at the hands of her brother. Another notepad is featured here with densely written, hard-to-read prose in pencil. Pencil gives a different impression than pen, as it is erasable, softer, and more tenuous than some of the earlier examples. Age is used repeatedly here to show the time of assault (10), the time of discovery (13), and the ongoing implications of her family's condoning of sexual violence from her brother. The age, innocence, and thus vulnerability of the participant is highlighted in the text (see also Littleton and Dodd, 2016), along with her anger toward her brother and family over his perceived entitlement to her body.
What Figure 3 has in common with many other submissions is the range of latent and manifest emotions conveyed such as outrage, indignation, guilt, blame, and grief made evident through lexical choices and the stylized nature of the signs. In fact, when looking at the results from the content analysis, the most common latent tone in submissions was one of ""anger"" (55%), followed next by ""resentment"" (16%). These emotions were conveyed via the use of capitalized letters (an affective register to shout through print) as seen in Figure 3 but also through the underlining or bolding of words, exclamation marks, and use of vibrant colors to highlight key words. These carefully crafted handwritten signs we argue are not only used to make experiences of sexual assault known, but operate to direct the reader's attention to particular parts of the narrative as a means of throwing an ""affective punch"" (Ahmed, 2017) through the screen. We see this again in Figure 4 where the contributor shares the ways her rape was delegitimized by her own mother as a ""one-night stand,"" supporting the rape myth that any assault in which the attack is not committed by a stranger, and where the victim does not put up a valiant fight, is easily categorized as ""just sex"" or ""sex gone a bit wrong"" (see Benedict, 1992;Gavey, 2005;Meyer, 2010;Moore, 2011). Written on a flash card typical of many pain memes (see Dobson, 2015), the message takes up the entire space on the article, giving the impression there is perhaps too much to say. Like the use of the felt pens in earlier examples, here we see that key messages such as ""DO THE MATH"" are both bolded and written in blue, with other critical information written in red and pink. ""Do the Math"" is both an appeal to a rational discourse of statistics around rape from known assailants, and an affective rhetorical strategy used to guide readers toward an ""appropriate response"" (Fileborn, 2019)-in this case belief that her story is true, and anger at the invalidation of her experience by her own mother. In this sense, affect takes on a stylized material form that works to not only attract the reader's attention but bring about particular affective resonance that would not be generated through a typed note, for example.
When considering the vernaculars which develop around the sharing of scripts of coercion on Who Needs Feminism? and those on offline spaces, there are some clear similarities. In both, it is rare to see detailed ""incident accounts"" (Bletzer and Koss, 2004), of specific sexual acts, labeling the experience as ""rape,"" or even providing information such as their age at the time of the assault, the location of the assault, or how they attempted to stop it. In fact, a dominant vernacular which developed on this site was not simply the descriptive details of personal experiences of sexual violence, but a common theme to narrate both the residual effects and their attendant affects, specifically a sense of generalized fear of sexual violence in their everyday lives (see also Vera-Gray, 2018). This sense of dread and fear is not only part of the developing vernacular and shared literacy of the site, but is in fact a ""performative condition of normative femininity"" (Campbell, 2005: 119), where women learn to view themselves as vulnerable, weak, and indefensible. As a result, they are conditioned to engage in safety work-or a range of tools, strategies, actions, and behaviors intended to avoid, mitigate or escape sexual violence (Kelly, 1988;Loney-Howes, 2018;Vera-Gray, 2018).
Researchers further argue that fear of sexual violence is in fact almost universal among women, regardless of their background, ethnicity, or other markers of identity (see Brownmiller, 1975;Cliff, 1984;Stanko, 1987;Valenti, 2007;Vera-Gray, 2018). 3 By drawing narratively upon this common experience/emotion between women, we argue that contributors were able to forge new mediated connections around why feminism is necessary. This was evident, for example, when participants shared their fear of going out alone at night, even for seemingly harmless activities such as taking out the trash, or as seen below, exercising in public alone: I need feminism and equality between genders because my fiancÃ© is free to do his jogging in public without fearing being assaulted. When I want to go running he comes with me so that no one attacks or violates me. I wish he wasn't afraid for me. I wish I wasn't afraid of every man that I cross in public.
While of course not all women live in constant fear of sexual violence, the potential of being sexually assaulted indeed causes many women to consider, if not alter routine behaviors and decisions (see also Campbell, 2005;Stanko, 1987;Vera-Gray, 2018). As evidenced above, in addition to fear, the participant demonstrates her longing to live in a different, better, and safer world, evident with the repetition of ""I wish."" There is also evidence of resentment at the ways she has come to fear ""every man that I cross in public.""
Outrage was also visceral in what was presumably well-meaning advice from others on how to avoid male violence: ""I need feminism because I start college in two weeks and have been told to 'try not to get raped,' as if being raped would somehow be my fault"" (italics original). Such submissions are designed to evoke responses like anger, not just about the prevalence of sexual violence, but about the way that women are constantly being taught to avoid rape, while men's behavior remains unchallenged (see also Vera-Gray, 2018). The affective tenor created in the submission is one of an ""intimate public"" (Khoja-Moolji, 2015), where contributors appeal to common aspects like fear, contempt or outrage. As Lawrence and Ringrose (2017) argue, it is the potential harnessing of these affects, to create solidarity through a collective sense of outrage that is being generated and forms specific vernaculars, or ways of documenting and therefore understanding sexual violence on this platform (see also Ringrose and Lawrence, 2018).
It seems then that vernacular practices found in digitized narrative accounts of sexual violence on Who Needs Feminism? create new affective practices, including the creative use of hand-written signs, bolded, italicized, and underlined letters, to communicate the force of feeling; vernacular practices such as ""hiding"" behind their signs have become common practice which convey fear and shame about reporting sexual violence. As we have shown, these include feelings of being victim-blamed, resentful, angry, sad, and mistrustful of the wider rape culture in which they live. These practices we argue, while holding great potential for opening new ways of generating a shared sense of feminist belonging which may foster wider social and ideological change are simultaneously ""problematic and limited"" (Fileborn, 2017(Fileborn, : 1485;;Salter, 2013). This is because the ""ability to harness the power of social media â€¦ is highly contingent upon the skills and social media skill of the victim/survivor."" In other words, these sites do not tell the stories of those survivors who lack the practical skills and/or knowledge of digital media culture to participate in social media campaigns such as Who Needs Feminism? As such, platform vernaculars ultimately render some stories invisible (e.g. older survivors, those with disabilities, or the poor) while amplifying others through circulatory practices like re-blogging.
While this article has begun the work of documenting many of the dominant ""digitized narratives"" of sexual violence, more can certainly be done to explore issues of access, power, and privilege in relation to the new practices and conventions that develop within specific platform contexts. This is an issue we keep in mind as we explore the very different vernaculars found on the hashtag #BeenRapedNeverReported, which are shaped we argue by the platform's unique affordances and architecture.
#BeenRapedNeverReported: hashtagging digitalized rape narratives
As a narrative device for sharing experiences of sexual violence, hashtags we argue, work in three key ways. First, on a practical organizational level, hashtags allow the user to remain within the character limit while thematically link their tweets to others addressing the same topic. Nathan Rambukkana (2015) argues that this linking function threads together related conversations across media platforms, making broad connections possible. In this way, like signs and memes discussed above, hashtags work to create a collective account of the systemic and widespread nature of sexual violence. 4  As we have argued elsewhere (Mendes et al., 2019), participating in hashtags such as #BeenRapedNeverReported can ""generate affective relations that are both personally healing, and which can also move participants to engage in initiatives"" such as forming sexual assault survivor support groups, or reporting their assault to the police-a form of activism which we recognize is not equally available to all victims, particularly those from communities who have long been stigmatized and persecuted within criminal justice systems (Davis, 2003;Palacios, 2016;Powell, 2015).
Second, the hashtag itself provides a way for victims to speak about their experience without having to directly say they were raped or assaulted. In other words, hashtags work as a stand in or placeholder for those who may find articulating their script of coercion painful or even impossible and constitutes a discursive practice only made possible through the architecture and affordances of platforms that link hashtags. This function cannot be dismissed, as it may be what in fact allows for narratives of assault to be digitally rendered in such high numbers, as we saw with #BeenRapedNeverReported, or more contemporary hashtags such as #MeToo. Third, the linking is not only discursive and semiotic but generates public forms of ""mediated"" affect, jolts that travel through the connected hashtag creating a stream of stories that join together experiences victims felt unable to report but are being documented en mass through the repeated (re)use of the hashtag. This repetition creates new forms of dialogue, connectivity, and awareness, which although may be temporary and ephemeral are nonetheless real and powerful (see Loney-Howes, 2018;Mendes et al., 2019).
Hashtags as a placeholder
When studying the scripts of coercion on #BeenRapedNeverReported, it is noticeable that words such as ""rape,"" ""assault,"" ""violated,"" and ""abused"" are conspicuous in their absence. Instead, readers are often left to ""read into"" the meaning of these experiences based on the use of the hashtag itself. In this sense, the hashtag is an essential part of the digitized narrative, serving as a placeholder for sexual violence and functioning as an important narrativ",6901,7986
10.2196/13837,,Modrek and Chakalov 2019,True,PhD Sepideh Modrek,The #MeToo Movement in the United States: Text Analysis of Early Twitter Conversations,"
Background:The #MeToo movement sparked an international debate on the sexual harassment, abuse, and assault and has taken many directions since its inception in October of 2017. Much of the early conversation took place on public social media sites such as Twitter, where the hashtag movement began.
Objective:The aim of this study is to document, characterize, and quantify early public discourse and conversation of the #MeToo movement from Twitter data in the United States. We focus on posts with public first-person revelations of sexual assault/abuse and early life experiences of such events.
Methods:We purchased full tweets and associated metadata from the Twitter Premium application programming interface between October 14 and 21, 2017 (ie, the first week of the movement). We examined the content of novel English language tweets with the phrase ""MeToo"" from within the United States (N=11,935). We used machine learning methods, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, and support vector machine models to summarize and classify the content of individual tweets with revelations of sexual assault and abuse and early life experiences of sexual assault and abuse. Results: We found that the most predictive words created a vivid archetype of the revelations of sexual assault and abuse. We then estimated that in the first week of the movement, 11% of novel English language tweets with the words ""MeToo"" revealed details about the poster's experience of sexual assault or abuse and 5.8% revealed early life experiences of such events. We examined the demographic composition of posters of sexual assault and abuse and found that white women aged 25-50 years were overrepresented in terms of their representation on Twitter. Furthermore, we found that the mass sharing of personal experiences of sexual assault and abuse had a large reach, where 6 to 34 million Twitter users may have seen such first-person revelations from someone they followed in the first week of the movement.Conclusions: These data illustrate that revelations shared went beyond acknowledgement of having experienced sexual harassment and often included vivid and traumatic descriptions of early life experiences of assault and abuse. These findings and methods underscore the value of content analysis, supported by novel machine learning methods, to improve our understanding of how widespread the revelations were, which likely amplified the spread and saliency of the #MeToo movement.
",2019-09-03,Journal of Medical Internet Research,JMIR Publications Inc.,"Introduction
Public discourse on sensitive topics, ranging from sexual violence to health (mis)behaviors, increasingly occurs on social networking platforms such as Twitter [1][2][3]. Public health officials and social scientists alike are turning to Twitter to better understand who participates in these conversations, what new information may be gleaned, and the reach of online messages. In health fields, studies of the content of social media posts have a variety of aims, including producing new data to support surveillance efforts, predicting onset of a variety of conditions, and targeting interventions [4]. Detailed content analyses of posts, above and beyond search frequencies and hashtag analysis, have examined health issues such as influenza, allergies, and a variety of mental health conditions (depression, postpartum depression, eating disorders, etc) [5][6][7][8][9][10]. Likewise, social scientists have conducted detailed content and network analysis of social media posts to understand salient topics in particular networks (Black Twitter and online Feminism) and the reach of salient topics [11][12][13][14].
The recent explosion in the public discourse on sexual violence is an interesting case to consider. Sexual violence, including sexual harassment, abuse, and assault, is highly pervasive and has long-term behavioral and mental health sequelae [15]. In the US, one in three women experience unwanted sexual contact in their lifetime [16]. Although hashtag movements such as #BeenRapedNeverReported had traction and encouraged public disclosures of personal experiences of rape [12], these initial movements were relatively small. The public discourse on sexual violence changed substantially on October 15, 2017, when actress Alyssa Milano called her followers to post ""MeToo"" if they had ever experienced unwanted or inappropriate sexual contact [5]. Ms Milano's tweet immediately went viral, with 1,595,453 tweets posted in the first week, and ignited a movement where victims of sexual assault, abuse, and harassment felt empowered to divulge as much, or as little, information as they wanted about their personal experiences. The phrase ""MeToo"" was coined by Tarana Burke, a civil rights activist, as a way to raise awareness and provide support for survivors of sexual violence. Ms Milano's use of this phrase in her tweet, as opposed to other more explicit hashtags such as #BeenRapedNeverReported, allowed posters to retain some privacy about the details of the event and still participate. This led to millions of users joining the conversation and subsequent normalizing of the revelations. Meanwhile, the wide use of the generic #MeToo encouraged an outpour of detailed revelations. Because of the massive size of the #MeToo movement, many who may not have experienced sexual violence were confronted with the knowledge that members of their network had.
In this study, we aim to describe the public disclosures of sexual violence within the first week of the #MeToo movement. Here, we document the content, quantify the scale, and present the demographic characteristics of Twitter users who disclose incidents of sexual assault/abuse in the early conversation on Twitter for the #MeToo movement. We use simple machine learning tools to create the archetype of tweets, which often included detailed accounts of sexual assault and abuse and early life experience of such events among women from all walks of life. Next, we categorize the content of individual-level tweets to estimate the proportion of all #MeToo tweets with such revelations in the first week of the movement. Furthermore, we use our categorization to detail the demographic characteristics of posters with revealed events and the reach of the revealed events on the Twitter platform generally.
Methods

Data
The data for this project are tweets, short messages of 140 characters or less, sent from a Twitter user (Twitter handle) to their network of followers. Twitter data are considered existing data in the public domain and therefore exempt from human subject review.
We applied for and were granted access to the Twitter Premium application programming interface (API) platform, which allows users to purchase and query all nondeleted public tweets since the first tweet posted in 2006. We purchased both the counts and full tweets from historical Twitter data between October 14 and 21, 2017 (ie, the first week of the movement). Unlike other social media movements that took several months to take hold, the #MeToo movement had the greatest activity in the first week (Figure 1), which is one reason we limited our data collection to this period. For our analysis, we concentrated only on novel, or user generated, English language tweets with ""MeToo"" in the text. Novel tweets exclude replies to other's tweets, retweets without comments, and links to other sites or images. This was chosen to capture posts that were tied to the specific user and that would be available to all of one's followers. We further limit the tweets to those with geotagged information, placing the tweet in the United States (N=12,337; this count is subject to some variability, as it depends on the day of the query and only includes nondeleted tweets).
Figure 1 shows the daily counts of novel English Language tweets starting from one day prior to the creation of each hashtag on Twitter (July 13, 2013, for BlackLivesMatter and October 14, 2017, for MeToo). The counts derived from the Twitter Premium API vary by the date of query. These counts were extracted on August 14, 2018.
The analytic sample for our content analyses comprised the full text and associated metadata for 97% of novel English language US-based tweets in the study period (N=11,935). Figure 2 presents a flowchart of the filtering process on the sample of tweets captured and analyzed (see Multimedia Appendix 1 for details of the selection process).  
Analyses
We first present evidence that the sample of novel English #MeToo tweets in the United States, which we selected for analysis, was comparable in terms of time trends to all novel English #MeToo tweets. We graphed the number of #MeToo tweets per hour starting on October 14, to show the time trends comparing all #MeToo tweets, novel English #MeToo tweets, and US-based geotagged novel English language #MeToo tweets. We also report quantitative measures of correlation on the number of tweets in each of these categories by hour (the Pearson correlation and coefficient of determination).
Annotation Process
Before analyzing the data, both authors reviewed approximately 2000 tweets from the first week of the movement. Based on this initial review, we chose to focus the analysis on first-person revelations of sexual assault and abuse and childhood experience of sexual assault and abuse. The tweets reviewed revealed several categories of comments with #MeToo hashtags. They included (1) tweets with #MeToo that were support statements (ie, ""How many women not in the spotlight have #MeToo #Notaceleb #StillAStar. Proud of them! As Bosch says-'everybody counts or nobody counts'""), (2) statements with ambiguous revelations of events (ie, ""MeToo"" alone and ""Kept it buried down for many years and didn't even really realize how it impacted me.""), (3) statements with detailed revelations of events (ie, ""I was sexually assaulted by a family member when I was 8 the trauma [sic] it causes never ends, remember that before you ruin someone's life""), and (4) others (ie, either negative comments, unrelated content, or riding off the hashtag; ""Not watched any games this weekend @NFL @nflcommish @nflnetwork #metoo didnt buy nfl merchandise this year Got refund for #NFLSundayTicket"").
Based on this initial review, we chose to focus on the second and third categories and created an annotation rubric to categorize first-person revelations. For ambiguous statements (ie, category 2) where it was clear an event occurred, such as a revelation with an alleged assailant's name or a situation but little details on the actual actions, we decided that this recollection likely reflects enduring trauma and should be categorized as a revealed abuse or assault. If the ambiguous events were experienced in childhood, it would be classified as an early life experience of abuse or assault (""I was a child too scared to speak. Till this day, it still haunts me""). If the statement was too ambiguous, did not make references to childhood, or provided little detail, we did not classify it as a case of abuse (ie, ""Sometimes the stories we don't share are the ones that affect us and continue to scare us the most"" and ""Tried to tweet about my #metoo moment and deleted it bc it still feels like my fault. The voices you aren't hearing in this are deafening""). For the third category-the clearest case-based on the purported event, we categorized the revelations as abuse or assault and early life experience based on the details provided. Figure 3 provides a schematic of our annotation process.
We randomly selected a subset of 650 tweets from the novel English US-based #MeToo tweets as the training set for the analysis. Based on our rubric, both authors classified the 650 randomly selected tweets. Each tweet was categorized along two main dimensions: if the tweet revealed details of an experience of sexual assault and abuse and if the details suggest that the event happened in early life. All other types of tweets (support, too ambiguous, or other) were categorized as not revealing an incident of abuse or assault. We used an approximate age cut off of 22 years (or references to college or earlier schooling) to distinguish and delineate early life experience. This was chosen to capture college experience under the category of early life. All other tweets were categorized as ""other."" The concordance between the two authors' categorizations was 94% for sexual abuse and assault and 98% for childhood experience. Most disagreements on the abuse/assault categorization were on cases with ambiguous revelations, which could be argued either way. Most disagreements on childhood experience were in cases where the revealed event was placed in the past. Many cases point to an event in the distant past, but it was hard to ascertain the age of the poster at the time of the revealed event, because we did not have the current age of the poster. Given these minor differences in interpretation, we decided to use one author's (BC) categorization in the training set. To assess our model performance, we used the other author's (SM) classification in the test set for calculating positive and negative predictive values.
Tweets were categorized along two dimensions: if they disclose an experience of sexual assault and abuse (red in Figure 3) and if the details suggest that the event happened in early life (orange in Figure 3). All other tweets were categorized as ""other."" Multimedia Appendix 2 provides examples of the categorizations performed by the authors, which were guided by the categorizations in the ""Rape Culture Pyramid"" graphic version 1 created by Ranger Cervix and Jaime Chandra in mid-2016 [17]. 
Prediction Methods
To provide exemplars of the disclosed tweets, we used simple supervised machine learning methods-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression models-on the training sample to find most predictive words for classification along both dimensions [18]. This allows us to present the most predictive words, which serve as an archetype of the tweets with such revelations. LASSO regressions are a common tool for economists who are using text as data and performing simple computational linguistic analyses [19]. The LASSO, a penalized linear model with L1 penalization, serves as a shrinkage method to help perform feature/word selection to identify the most predictive words from a list of candidate words in a supervised learning environment. These methods are recommended because they are intuitive and interpretable. LASSO regression was chosen over ridge regression, another penalized linear models with L2 penalization, because it is more efficient for variable selection. Furthermore, LASSO was chosen over elastic net regression, which is sometimes preferred when there is substantial correlation between features/words, because we found limited correlation in the words in the training set data.
After removing stop words, we had 11,931 unique words in our training set from 650 tweets. We stemmed each word, examined the list for misspelling, and considered words (and stubs) that appear in at least five tweets to limit the sparsity of our sample, leading to 1186 unique words. From these words, the authors selected 109 words related to sexual abuse and assault. This filtering limited the sparsity of the data further. We then used LASSO regressions on a matrix of 650 tweets coded for sexual assault/abuse (or coded for early life experience) and 109 words, each of which was treated as a binary flag if it appeared in each tweet. For example, if the tweet included the word ""Rape"" or ""Raped"" in it, then the variable ""Rape"" was coded as 1.
The LASSO model minimizes an objective function , which is a constrained ordinary least squares model (OLS), to find the words with the strongest predictive power on tweets coded as having a revelation of sexual assault or abuse.
Equation 1:
, where is the L1 Norm of the estimated Î² coefficients; this is the sum of the absolute value of all the Î² coefficients, and is the sum of squared deviation of the predicted outcome relative to the actual outcome for each observation. This algorithm is the same as an OLS with an added penalization for large estimated Î² coefficients. The form of the penalization with an L1 Norm drives the magnitude of many Î² coefficients to zero. This essentially makes the algorithm identify and select features/words that are most predictive [18].
The LASSO models were implemented in the statistical software R ([computer program] Version 3.5.0. Vienna, Austria: R Foundation for Statistical Computing; 2018) using the ""glmnet"" package. The results of the LASSO model are validated with ten-fold cross-validation. The cross-validation allows us to pick the model with the Î» value having the lowest mean squared error or model variance. From this selected model, we obtained a list of the 35 most predictive words for tweets with revelations of sexual assault/abuse words and 34 most predictive words for tweets with revelations of early life experience of sexual assault/abuse words. These word lists were then categorized by the authors.
We then used the same training sample of tweets to train the support vector machine (SVM) models to classify the remaining sample of tweets (N=11,285) along the same two dimensions-experience of sexual assault/abuse and early life experience of sexual assault/abuse [18,20].
An SVM is a discriminative classifier that is used on training data to define a separating hyperplane in multidimensional space and then uses this hyperplane to categorize new data. In the training set, data points that are closer to a potential defining hyperplane (ie, support vectors) are given more weight. The goal of the underlying algorithm is to maximize the margin between the support vector data points and the separating hyperplane using a cost function [18].
In our case, we have a matrix of 11,931 unique words (dimensions) and 650 labeled outcome data. From this information, the algorithm defines a separating hyperplane. Based on this hyperplane, the remaining 11,285 tweets are categorized. To perform the SVM model operations, the package ""RTextTools"" was used in R software.
We assessed the quality of the SVM model's classification with four test sets, two for each classification category, to estimate positive and negative predictive values. To calculate the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), we sampled 50 tweets four times as test sets. The first two samples were used to assess PPV and NPV for the model predictions of sexual assault and abuse. The second two samples were used to assess PPV and NPV for the model predictions of early life experience of sexual assault and abuse. Given that BC's classification was used in the training set, we used SM's classification on the test set to assess the model.
For each sample of the first two samples, one author (SM) assessed the content of the tweet for a revelation of an experience of sexual assault and abuse. We treated the human-assessed content as the gold standard and calculated the proportion of the time that the SVM algorithm's classification was the same as the human classification. PPV was calculated as the number of true positives (agreement between human and algorithm) divided by the number of positive cases found by the SVM algorithm. NPV was calculated as the number of true negatives divided by the number of negative cases found by the SVM algorithm. We repeat the process and manually categorize the content of the last two samples for revelations of early life experience of sexual assault or abuse to calculate PPV and NPV Based on these classifications, we used a previously vetted commercial service, Demographics Pro [21,22], to infer the demographic characteristics of the individuals who revealed an incident of abuse/assault and childhood experience (Multimedia Appendix 1 for description of their algorithm) . We then empirically derived estimates of the 25%-75% range of the number of followers from each poster who revealed an event.
This allows us to conduct a crude calculation to capture a lower bound on the reach of the tweets with revelations of sexual assault/abuse in the first week of the movement. This estimate represents the number of potential Twitter users who would have been exposed to revelations of sexual assault/abuse posted by someone they follow.
Results
Figure 4 shows the time trends of #MeToo tweets, illustrating how the movement grew. We presented hourly counts of tweets from October 14, 2017, 00:00 GMT, the day before the movement began. We also compared all #MeToo tweets, the novel English #MeToo tweets, and the novel geotagged English #MeToo tweets-the main sample used in this study-to show that they follow a similar overall time trend in the first week. The Pearson correlation between the counts of hourly #MeToo tweets and novel geotagged English #MeToo tweets was 0.96, and the coefficient of determination was 0.92. The counts derived from the Premium API in Figure 4 vary by the date of query. These counts were extracted on June 12, 2018. Author BC's classification of the 650 randomly selected tweets in the training set revealed that approximately 19% of these tweets included a first-person revelation of sexual assault/abuse. BC's classification was used in supervised machine learning methods with LASSO regressions to identify the most predictive words. Textbox 1 summarizes and organizes the most predictive words related to revelations of sexual abuse/assault. The most predictive words are organized into descriptions of time, persons, actions, body parts, and words indicating state and other. For example, the predictive actions verbs include ""Rape,"" ""Grope,"" ""Grab,"" and ""Shout"" among others. Other highly predictive words relate to an intoxicated state (""Drunk"" or ""Drug""). Many predictive words placed the revealed event in the past, particularly in early life (""Age,"" ""College,"" ""First Time,"" and ""Years Old""). Bottom: Hourly counts of all novel English language tweets with the phrase ""MeToo"" and hourly counts of all novel English language geotagged tweets in the United States.

Of the 650 randomly selected tweets in the training set, the authors categorized 5% of the tweets as having indicated an early experience of sexual assault/abuse. Textbox 2 summarizes and organizes the most predictive words related to early experience of sexual abuse or assault. Although many of the predictive terms are the same, the list of persons, or possible assailants, listed for those who had an early life experience include terms like ""Neighbor"" and ""Step-Father."" In addition, the states of being ""Asleep"" and ""Afraid"" are highly predictive. Together, these predictive words provide a picture of the types of tweets posted during the early phase of the movement. Note that predictive words are different from a word cloud that captures the frequency of a word. For example, ""MeToo"" was in every one of the tweets we examined but was not, and could not be, predictive of a disclosure of sexual assault/abuse, given our method. The word ""Grope,"" on the other hand, was not in every tweet and was a predictive word in tweets with revelations of assault/abuse.
Next, we use the SVM algorithm on the same 650 classified tweets in the training set. Of the remaining 11,285 tweets, the SVM algorithm categorized 1287 tweets (11.4%) as having a revelation of sexual assault/abuse and 657 tweets (5.8%) as having a revelation of early sexual assault/abuse (Multimedia Appendix 3). To assess the validity of the SVM classification, we calculate both the PPV and NPV in comparison with human categorized test sets. The SVM classification for sexual assault/abuse had a PPV of 87%, meaning that there is 87% concordance between the algorithm and our manual assessment of the tweets with revelation of sexual assault/abuse. The NPV was 83%, suggesting that the algorithm may have slightly underreported the number of tweets with revelations of sexual assault/abuse in comparison to the authors' assessment. For early life experience classification, the PPV is 79% and the NPV is 95%. There was a slightly lower concordance between the algorithm and the authors' assessment of tweets identified as revealing an early life experience of sexual assault/abuse, but the false negative rate was quite low. Together, these assessments of the algorithm suggest that our algorithm performed well and would be highly congruent with the human-generated classifications.
In Table 1, we present the percentage of daily tweets with revelations of sexual assault/abuse and early life experience of sexual assault/abuse based on the SVM classification. In the first 2 days of the movement (October 15-17), 11%-13% of tweets revealed an experience of sexual abuse or assault and over half of the tweets revealed that the experience of sexual assault/abuse occurred in early life. As the movement carried forward, the revelations of sexual assault/abuse decreased to about 6% of MeToo tweets in the last day of the first week, but the relative proportion with early life experience of these events increased to over 80%, suggesting that more traumatic events were being shared.
Based on the SVM classification, we then used the Demographics Pro prediction service to understand and compare the demographics of posters of sexual assault/abuse during the early #MeToo movement. We present these demographics in Table 2. Based on the results of the SVM model, we identified 1168 unique posters/Twitter handles that revealed an incident of sexual assault/abuse and 612 unique posters that revealed an early life experience of sexual assault/abuse. We shared these Twitter handles with Demographics Pro, who then gave us aggregated predictions on the distribution of the demographic characteristics of these posters. We found that 90% of these Twitter users who posted about their experience of sexual assault/abuse were women. This is congruent with national estimates that 90% of sexual assault victims are women [23].
We also found that white women were overrepresented in the early conversation in our Twitter data with regard to their population in the United States, their proportion as Twitter users, and national estimates of those who report experiencing sexual assault (data not shown). The age distribution also shows that older users of Twitter, aged 25-50 years, disproportionately revealed events.
Finally, from the SVM classification, we used the provided metadata on the number of followers of posters who revealed sexual assault/abuse in the first week of the #MeToo movement to better understand the reach of such revelations. Based on posters' follower count, we took the 25%-75% range of followers from users with such experiences and calculated a lower bound range on the number of Twitter user who may have seen a first-person revelation. This simplistic calculation provided a range of 5,955,342 to 34,251,628 Twitter users for the reach, which we believe is a substantial lower bound (Multimedia Appendix 3).
We believe the reported reach is an underestimate, because we did not include replies or retweets and our algorithm has a higher false negative rate. We did not examine the network of people who reveal events, which could be highly overlapping and would mean that many users would have seen multiple tweets with revelations. Furthermore, the distribution of followers who posted about sexual assault does not seem to vary substantially from the distribution of followers for Twitter users overall (Multimedia Appendix 4). Finally, we only captured posts on Twitter. Many were also posting #MeToo posts on other social media platforms such as Facebook.

Discussion

Principal Findings
We conduct the first quantitative text analysis of the content of the early conversation in the #MeToo movement on Twitter, which was the largest hashtag movement on Twitter in 2017 [24] and the largest public discourse on sexual violence. We use machine learning to provide exemplars of disclosures during the first week of the movement. The most predictive words create an archetype of the content of tweets with the revelation of sexual assault/abuse. They include words that we would expect like ""grope"" and ""rape"" as well as states like ""drunk,"" ""asleep,"" and ""afraid."" Based on our models, 11% of novel tweets in the first week of the movement publicly revealed an experience of sexual assault/abuse and 6% revealed an early life experience of sexual assault/abuse. The initial women sharing were predominately white women aged 25-50 years. Tweets from older posters suggest that these experiences were lodged into these women's memories and were not inconsequential passing events. Notably, African Americans were underrepresented relative to their Twitter presence in this early conversation. Moreover, given the connectivity possible on Twitter, we estimate that between 6 and 34 million Twitter users may have been exposed to at least one such detailed revelation.
Limitations
There are key limitations to this study that should be noted. First, based on financial considerations, we could not extract all novel English language posts during the first week of the #MeToo movement. Instead, we chose to focus on those geotagged within the United States. This restriction made the purchase of almost all the tweets that fit this category possible. To examine the representativeness of these tweets, we examined time patterns relative to all #MeToo posts and novel English language #MeToo posts (Figure 3). This analysis suggests that the timing of novel English language geotagged tweets was not different from novel English language tweets. However, if users who allow Twitter to geotag tweets systematically revealed sexual assault/abuse events at a different rate than those who do not allow Twitter to geotag their tweets, then our estimates may be inaccurate. However, we noted that users would have likely enabled geotagging on Twitter at some time prior to their MeToo tweet. Thus, allowing geotagging is not necessarily related to the MeToo tweet. Second, we include only English tweets on the topic of #MeToo even though there were similar movements in different languages (such as #YoTambien or #BalanceTonPorc), and we did note examine tweets outside the United States. For example UK-based or Canada-based English language #MeToo tweets were not included in our data. Again, there could be systematic differences that would affect our estimates, and thus, we acknowledge that our estimates reflect the conversation in the United States. Third, while we examined the time dynamics of many related or counter hashtag movements happening the same week, such as #HimThough, #Ibelieveyou, #Ihearyou, #Iwillnot, and #howIwillchange, we did not include these in our analyses because these hashtags were in response to the #MeToo posts. The content of tweets with these other hashtags were less likely to have revelations of sexual assault/abuse, but rather just voice support. Future analyses could examine who voiced support rather than who revealed events. Fourth, we did not conduct network analysis examining common retweets, which would have had much greater reach. Our focus was on novel revelations that were rarely retweeted relative to support statements, which were often retweeted. Fifth, we only examined the first week of the movement. This was a deliberate choice because the movement went in many directions afterward, with calls to stop posting traumatic events because they triggered women [25] or demands that men post instead of women having to post and relive their trauma. Finally, many tweets were ambiguous, revealing that something happened but without enough detail to determine if there was abuse or assault. Nonetheless, we used a consistent method based on our reading of thousands of tweets. The NPV and PPV of the trained machine learning estimates were good, based on our annotation. However, a different pair of annotators may have had slightly different estimates.
Conclusions
Despite the noted limitations, our results highlight the magnitude of the mass sharing of personal experiences of sexual assault/abuse, filled with narratives of early life experience, which enabled the spread of the #MeToo movement and had a broad reach across Twitter. Further, these tweets and the archetypes presented here provide rich details to augment existing statistics captured traditionally from survey data and small in-depth studies of sexual assault and abuse survivors. The archetype provides a picture of what the public saw. The candid and revealing statements reminded followers and the public alike of the magnitude sexual violence and how it is often first experienced in early life and hidden. Therefore, the descriptive narratives could be used in public health survey development to assess whether there has been a change or a deeper public understanding of the prevalence, early life experience, and enduring trauma of sexual assault and abuse.
The summary of the content of tweets presented in this study highlights the initial conversation and demographics of participants in the conversation in the early stages of the #MeToo movement. Although our results present a snapshot of the public discourse on sexual violence and the initial participants, future work could examine the content and directions of the national conversation, which has since taken many directions and varies by populations.",6364,7166

Digital platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook and online communities on reddit, are increasingly used by victim-survivors across the world to post about their experiences of sexual violence. Emerging research suggests a variety of reasons why victim-survivors discuss their experiences online. This article contributes to this developing area of research by exploring the underlying motivations for victim-survivors using an online rape survivor community on reddit. This article questions how and why victim-survivors of sexual violence engage with digital technologies through content analysis of narratives posted to a public rape survivor forum on reddit. Overall, the study found that there are three primary motivators prompting survivors to access online communities: to find a supportive community; to seek advice; and for storytelling. The article uncovers some of the broader implications of online storytelling, suggesting that this is an important framework to consider online disclosures of sexual violence. Online communities like /r/rapecounseling might be conceptualised as spaces where counter-narratives of sexual violence are collectively shared.
",2018-03-01,"International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy",Queensland University of Technology,"Introduction
Sexual violence is a pervasive form of violence against women (World Health Organization 2013: 10). In Australia, one in five women will experience sexual violence in their lifetime, with similar figures evident across the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2017;Breiding et al. 2014; Ministry of Justice, Home Office and Office for National Statistics 2013). Internationally, criminal justice systems have routinely failed to address the needs and best interests of victim-survivors of rape and sexual assault, who often have negative experiences, especially during the processes of police investigation and trial (Clark 2015;Daly and Bouhours 2010;Lievore 2003). Negative experiences, along with the high attrition rates of sexual violence cases in the criminal justice system, perhaps partly explain why instances of sexual violence remain underreported globally (Daly and Bouhours 2010;Lievore 2003). However, while most victim-survivors are unlikely to report their experiences of sexual violence in a formal justice setting, there is an increasing trend of survivors talking about their experiences online.
The discipline of criminology is, arguably, yet to properly explore how and why victim-survivors are using digital platforms in the aftermath of sexual violence. Digital technologies and 'new media' provide different ways for victim-survivors to connect with one another (Burrows and Summers 2011). For example, twitter hashtags such as #BeenRapedNeverReported allow victimsurvivors to collectively and publicly share why they did not report sexual violence (Ferreras 2014). Some criminologists have begun to explore these ways that victim-survivors use digital platforms, especially in the form of public activism and 'digilantism' (Fileborn 2014;Salter 2013).
However, victim-survivors are also accessing digital platforms in more 'private' ways, by using online rape survivor communities. Subreddits, Facebook groups, forum websites such Pandora's Aquarium, Tumblr accounts like Project Unbreakable, among others, allow survivors to connect to seek support amongst peers (Andalibi et al. 2016;Burrows and Summers 2011;Galli 2014;Powell and O'Neill 2016). Online disclosures in these 'private' or anonymous contexts may be occurring for differing reasons than those suggested by criminological research on victimsurvivor use of digital platforms to date. As such, this article explores the motivations for victimsurvivors to disclose their experience in a private context, building upon the limited criminological knowledge of this phenomenon.
In this article, I firstly provide an overview of literature that has sought to understand online communities, victim-survivor online disclosures, and potential motivations for sharing experiences of sexual violence online. Then, I briefly describe the methodology of the article: a content analysis of a rape survivor community on reddit called /r/rapecounseling. 1 In the findings and discussion section, I focus on three emergent themes suggesting why victimsurvivors use the community. My analysis reveals that victim-survivors are motivated to access reddit for support and community; to seek advice; and, importantly, for storytelling. I argue that online communities can be integral to survivors' voices and stories being recognised. I suggest that further research and analysis is needed to fully understand how storytelling through digital platforms impacts victim-survivors of sexual violence.
Literature review

Speaking out online: Literature about the benefits of online communities
Research into online platforms has consistently questioned the divide between virtual and real. Rather than seeing these as distinct spheres of experience, scholars are increasingly blurring online/offline engagement (McGerty 2000;Jones 1999). Online communities exist within social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook where users have a profile page and can connect to other users through private and public messages and groups. Online communities also exist in the form of chat rooms, online message boards, forums and blogging communities. Reddit is an example of a social networking platform where users interact in smaller online communities known as subreddits. Online communities are increasingly the topic of research across a variety of academic disciplines.
Researchers increasingly treat online communities in the same way as real-world communities (Preece, Maloney-Krichmar and Abras 2003). Just as in the real world, online communities are made up of social norms, values and behaviours (Herring 2004). Users might choose to participate (or not participate) in online communities to varying degrees. For instance, online communities may be comprised of public and non-public members, people who post to the community, and people who 'lurk'. Those who participate actively online (through posting to discussions and chatting with other users) will have different experiences to those who are passive (who simply read others' discussions and content). Nonnecke, Andrews and Preece (2006) found that the experiences of 'lurkers', while not entirely negative, are likely to be less positive when compared to members who actively post to an online community.
Online communities, particularly peer support communities for illnesses (including various cancers, HIV/AIDS, depression and chronic diseases), have been subject to extensive research. This research indicates that participating in an online group is empowering and reduces loneliness (van Uden-Kraan et al. 2009). In some communities, high-frequency users have to do more emotional work than those less active in order to meet the needs of other users (Winefield 2006). Other studies measure the role of anonymity, empathy and psychological impacts of online support communities, all indicating that higher participation in online communities led to better health outcomes and the facilitation of social support (Coulson, Buchanan and Aubeeluck 2007;Coursaris and Liu 2009;Mo andCoulson 2008, 2013). Contrastingly, pro-anorexia online communities have been criticised amongst researchers for encouraging eating disorders by offering community and friendship to vulnerable participants (Boero and Pascoe 2012). Haas et al. (2011) refer to these communities as online negative enabling support groups, which encourage harmful behaviours in their members. Despite this critique of online communities, research overwhelmingly suggests that access to online support provides positive outcomes to users. Perhaps these positive outcomes attract victim-survivors to discuss their experiences in online communities.
From disclosure to digilantism: Why are victim-survivors accessing digital platforms?
Although this is an under-researched area, scholars have suggested a few ways that victimsurvivors of sexual violence use digital platforms. The first of these is to disclose their experiences (Moors and Webber 2013). Sexual violence researchers acknowledge that victim-survivors commonly experience negative responses to disclosure, such as not being believed, being blamed or to having their experience questioned and invalidated (Herman 2005). Perhaps victimsurvivors might disclose online because they want to have their story heard or to find a community that can offer support (Powell 2015a). Victim-survivors have written about their experiences on personal blogs or, for example, shared their stories with online communities such as 'Project Unbreakable' on Tumblr (Fawcett and Shrestha 2016;Powell 2015aPowell , 2015b)). This Tumblr community is a space for victim-survivors to share images, typically of themselves holding a paper sign detailing narratives of their abuse, without naming the perpetrator.
Secondly, criminologists suggest that disclosing online could be described as online activism or 'cyber justice', whereby victim-survivors are using informal spaces to raise awareness around sexual violence and rape culture (Powell 2015b;Sills et al. 2016). Fileborn (2014) notes that, for street harassment, a type of sexual violence for which formal responses are often limited, online initiatives such as Hollaback! provide victim-survivors with a way to share their experience while contributing to an activist project. She also notes that, by sharing about their experiences online, victim-survivors might be meeting their 'justice needs' of having a voice, being believed, being heard and having control over their experience (Fileborn 2014) 2011; McGlynn, Westmarland and Godden 2012). Some criminologists have begun to explore how victim-survivors might fulfil these justice needs through digital platforms (Fileborn 2014;Powell 2015b;Salter 2013).
However, research simultaneously suggests that victim-survivors may be using digital platforms for revenge (Salter 2013). Hai-Jew (2014) notes that online 'vengeance culture' encourages the hacking and sharing of private information, the distribution of revenge pornography or the sharing of violent videos. Nevertheless, for victim-survivors, this 'vengeance culture' can manifest through online naming and shaming of perpetrators (Filipovic 2012;Powell 2015b;Salter 2013).
There are instances, such as the Savannah Dietrich case in the US, where a victim-survivor used Twitter to name her rapist in response to an inadequate verdict given by the criminal justice system (Henry and Powell 2016;Salter 2013). Increasingly, there are instances where victimsurvivors are naming their perpetrators, both in closed groups on Facebook or publicly through the media (Cohen and Ryan 2017).
Research beyond the discipline of criminology suggests that some victim-survivors are using digital platforms for support and advice. This seems to be the purpose of online forum communities and 'question and answer sites' such as Yahoo! Answers or reddit, which provide a space where survivors can ask questions and anonymously seek support from peers (Andalibi et al. 2016;Moors andWebber 2013, 2015;Webber and Wilmot 2013;Webber 2014). Humancomputer interaction researchers Andalibi, Haimson, Choudury and Forte (2016) studied online disclosures of sexual abuse on reddit using a mixed methods approach where they categorised disclosures and used statistical analysis across three subreddits. Their work found that victimsurvivors use different levels of anonymity on reddit, which results in different types of disclosures. They suggest that increased anonymity allows victim-survivors to seek more support (Andalibi et al. 2016: 3914). Their analysis focuses on subreddits as a place for victim-survivors to seek support, while also commenting that 'uncovering reasons why one would disclose on reddit or other online platforms for the first time ever is an area for future research' (Andalibi et al. 2016: 3915, emphasis in original).
Further, Webber and Moors (Moors and Webber 2013;Webber and Moors 2015) conducted studies analysing victim-survivors' posts to Yahoo! Answers where a qualified sexual assault counsellor would provide responses to their questions. Analysis of these posts found that victimsurvivors were disclosing experiences to seek advice and general emotional support, and that victim-survivors in more vulnerable positions were more likely to post online (Moors and Webber 2013;Webber and Moors 2015). These studies indicate that victim-survivors may be motivated by feelings beyond 'revenge' when accessing online communities. However, criminological research is yet to fully explore how victim-survivors use digital platforms, especially online communities. The limited research available on victim-survivors' access of online spaces has consistently revealed that further analysis of survivors' posts on forums, blogs and social media platforms is necessary.
Storytelling and survival: The justice of being heard
Looking beyond disclosure and 'digilantism', victim-survivors might also use various digital platforms to tell their story, to be heard and validated in their experiences. However, there is limited research exploring how online spaces are platforms for such storytelling, or how this is may be an overarching framework to consider online disclosures of sexual violence. Research suggests that, in other contexts such as war-time tribunals and transitional justice processes, testimony and bearing witness can provide victim-survivors with formal recognition and public denouncement of the wrongs and harms of sexual violence (Chare 2012; Greenspan et al. 2014;Hackett and Rolston 2009;Henry 2009Henry , 2015)). Storytelling is an interactive process which requires both 'willing storytellers and willing and able listeners' (Ross 2003: 326). This suggests that, for effective storytelling to occur, a victim-survivor needs to find their voice and have an IJCJ&SD 48 Online version via www.crimejusticejournal.com Â© 2018 7(1) audience for their story. Research emphasises that victim-survivors of sexual violence want to be heard, and see this as part of the justice process (Clark 2010;McGlynn, Westmarland and Godden 2012;Ross 2003).
However, given the consistent limitations of formal criminal justice systems to 'hear' and acknowledge the stories of victim-survivors, there is scope to think about online spaces as contexts in which storytelling can occur (Lievore, 2003;Daly and Bouhours, 2010;Clark 2015).
As WÃ¥nggren (2016: 407) notes, 'through sharing stories and â€¦ other online communications, technologies increasingly become central ways for countering â€¦ gender-based violence'. Online communication allows some victim-survivors to find their voice and have control over how they share their experience (Fileborn 2014;Moors and Webber 2013; Loney-Howes forthcoming; Powell 2015a). Loney-Howes (forthcoming) highlights that victim-survivors' anti-rape blogs allow for a less 'prescriptive' narrative of rape to emerge. Traditional responses to rape, such as through the criminal justice system or therapeutic interventions, tend to create 'rape scripts' and produce an unspeakability about experiences of sexual violence, while online spaces provide a way for survivors to take control over storytelling (Loney-Howes forthcoming). Loney-Howes (forthcoming) comments that speaking out online can act to 'shift the hegemonic rape script; to construct a new way of speaking and witnessing that goes beyond the frameworks through which rape and trauma are normatively articulated'. In this way, victim-survivor's storytelling online is both therapeutic and political (Loney-Howes forthcoming). However, there are also potential limitations of online storytelling, notably, that it may be hard to determine whether victimsurvivors' stories are being heard. Fileborn (2014) notes potential ways that researchers could measure whether a victim-survivor's account is heard; for example, through quantifying 'likes' or comments on stories. She indicates that further research is needed to determine the impacts on victim-survivors when an audience does not engage with their stories (Fileborn 2014).
This review has highlighted the small body of research that is exploring how and why victimsurvivors of sexual violence engage with digital platforms, suggesting that it could be to disclose their experience, for activism, for justice or for revenge. Research into online communities suggests that they are overwhelmingly positive for people who use them to seek support. While some scholars have discussed victim-survivors' online storytelling, there is a gap in literature that specifically explores rape survivor communities. This article builds upon the work of these scholars that explore victim-survivors' use of online platforms and, in my analysis, I consider storytelling as an important overarching framework to consider victim-survivors' motivations to post online.
Methodology
This article presents findings of a content analysis of original posts made to /r/rapecounseling, a publicly accessible rape survivor community on reddit. /r/rapecounseling is an online community where victim-survivors of sexual violence share posts, ask questions and receive support. Towards the end of 2017, over 7,000 reddit users followed the subreddit, which typically receives new posts daily. The platform reddit is a popular online community or 'social news site' that allows users to communicate in 'threaded conversations' on a variety of topics (Choi et al. 2015). Reddit users interact via posts and comments to forum-style communities, known as 'subreddits', which encompass a vast spectrum of topics. These spaces are typically public; however, users with accounts, who mostly remain anonymous, can vote or comment on posts.
Typically, public online content can be analysed without formal ethical approval. However, research involving vulnerable groups like victim-survivors raises ethical concerns. For example, it was important in this research that victim-survivors' disclosures remained anonymous, despite their posts being publicly visible. Some victim-survivors indicated that their online disclosure was the first and only place they had discussed their experience of sexual violence. Network to analyse posts made to /r/rapecounseling. Like other studies that have researched reddit, I removed the usernames, dates and times, and some of the words of posts to try to ensure that victim-survivors are anonymous (Andalibi et al. 2016).
I analysed 200 original posts made to the subreddit over one calendar month in 2016. The sample size represents the posts that were made to the community over the time-span of that month. Subsequently, 24 of these posts were removed from the analysis because they were made by family, friends, partners or researchers, rather than victim-survivors. As such, a purposive sampling method was used, where 176 posts were analysed, where the author of a post had specified or implied that they were a victim-survivor of sexual violence (Morse 2004). Content analysis was limited to the original posts made, and not the comments made by other users of /r/rapecounseling.
Posts vary in size, from one word, to lengthy entries detailing experiences of sexual violence and its aftermath. Posts were collected using N-Capture, and coded using N-Vivo 11 by means of an inductive coding approach, whereby codes were derived directly from the data, rather than coding according to a prescribed framework or by making assumptions about the text (SaldaÃ±a 2013). Conducting content analysis of these codes allowed preliminary themes to emerge that suggest reasons why survivors are using /r/rapecounseling. Through content analysis, I was also able to determine certain details about some of the users posting to /r/rapecounseling that may provide context to the findings and discussion to follow.
As noted above, all users in this space were anonymous but some gave details about themselves to contextualise their posts. Such details include countries of residence, which were primarily the US, Canada and the UK. Some victim-survivors would specify their gender; however, a majority did not indicate this. Some would nominate age and sexuality. However, because many victimsurvivors did not specify all of these details, it was difficult to make generalisations about the data. Because of this, I have chosen to use the gender neutral 'they' pronoun when referring to individual victim-survivors' posts in the following section.
Findings and discussion: What brings survivors to /r/rapecounseling?
The data suggest that there are three key motivators that were leading victim-survivors to post to the subreddit: the need of a supportive community; to seek advice or help; or for storytelling.
Needing a supportive community
Many victim-survivors posted to /r/rapecounseling seeking emotional support and to be heard by a community of peers. This is reinforced by the findings of other studies into online communities for people with chronic illness, cancers or mental health issues (Mo 2016;Mo andCoulson 2013, 2014;van Uden-Kraan et al. 2009). However, unlike some members of those communities, many victim-survivors of sexual violence describe being unable to disclose their experiences in their 'real lives'. For some, there is a sense of vulnerability and the fear of ramifications in revealing their stories, even when it is anonymous:
I'm really scared to post this but I really need help. I am so afraid to ask anyone in real life, been so afraid to even voice this. I've been feeling very alone and isolated because of it. (139)
As with other online communities, the anonymity of /r/rapecounseling acts as a safety net, allowing survivors to discuss their real-world vulnerabilities. Some victim-survivors expressed fear around their families finding out, while others were fearful of responses by perpetrators. Further, victim-survivors feared victim-blaming, whether it be from friends, family or the broader community, and preferred the anonymity and safety of reddit as a result. This indicates that online communities such as /r/rapecounseling are a supportive space and essential to survivors who feel isolated.
However, some victim-survivors posted in /r/rapecounseling for support despite having also disclosed to a real-life support network. This is perhaps because, for some, the process of disclosing to a loved one had been complicated, difficult and resulted in not receiving the support they expected:
I've literally never opened up this fully about it, not even my fiancÃ© as I said, to anyone since it started 22 years ago. I told him one night, some basics. He [started] to cry, and it was the first time I'd ever seen him cry like that. It made me feel awful, I felt mad at him, that he thought he had any right to cry about it, after all it didn't happen to him. Then I felt guilty for that feeling, and awful I'd even feel such a selfish thing. It was a mess, emotionally, so I've never brought it up again. (199)
For this victim-survivor, their disclosure to a loved one led them to stop discussing their experiences at all. Research suggests that victim-survivors' first experiences of disclosing sexual violence is important and determines whether they will continue to seek professional help or report to an authority (Clark and Quadara 2010). As is reflected in the following post, when victim-survivors are not believed, it can further enhance the trauma of their experience:
How the fuck am I supposed to trust people and be open? â€¦ How am I supposed to try to get over it and be open if it my openness does nothing but hurt me? (172)
As with the earlier stories represented here, this victim-survivor found it difficult to seek support in the real world, but this was caused by the 'hurt' experienced when disclosing.
Spaces like /r/rapecounseling allow victim-survivors to find a community without forcing them to be open about their name or real-world identity, which for some victim-survivors has the potential to have serious consequences. Anonymity and privacy is important for victim-survivors who, for whatever reason, feel they cannot discuss their experiences of trauma publicly or to a professional sexual violence support worker. For those who are socially isolated or still experiencing an abusive relationship, online communities may be the only spaces where they are able to feel supported or heard:
I have never told this to anyone so I decided Ill post it here in reddit cause I'm anonymous here and felt like getting it off my chest. ( 150)
For this victim-survivor, anonymity was a key attraction of the subreddit; it provided them with the security they needed to be able to share their story. This victim-survivor also needed an audience to receive their story, so they could 'get it off their chest'. This emphasises the importance of these spaces in allowing rape narratives to be heard (Herman 2005;McGlynn, Westmarland and Godden 2012). Similarly, other victim-survivors would express gratitude to those in /r/rapecounseling who took the time to read their stories: perhaps emphasises the importance of these communities to their users, who treat each other with mutual support and consideration.
Emotional and psychological support was a key reason for many victim-survivors to post to /r/rapecounseling. Many indicated that their mental health was low which led to them asking for help on reddit: These victim-survivors needed support in a time of personal crisis and stress, perhaps when it was not possible to approach a friend, family member or professional support. Perhaps they needed to be able access support in the moment, during a sleepless night. Importantly, technology allows survivors to access support at any time of the day. Victim-survivors also are also using /r/rapecounseling to affirm that others have experienced similar feelings and emotions in the aftermath of sexual violence. This too, was a form of seeking emotional support and validation in the community. Typically, this might be combined with asking a question or for advice, such as:
I guess half of me is writing this now to know I'm not wrong to feel this way. Any advice? ( 75)
Other users of /r/rapecounseling would often express their solidarity through comments, which, as noted above, was beyond the scope of analysis in this article. However, it should be noted that, along with emotional and psychological support, giving and seeking advice is another important feature of /r/rapecounseling, and a key motivator prompting survivors to post.
Seeking advice on /r/rapecounseling
Many victim-survivors post to /r/rapecounseling seeking advice about how to cope with the varying impacts of sexual violence, or with practical issues in the aftermath of such an experience. For example, several victim-survivors sought advice on legal processes and how to report their assault, or how to write a victim impact statement:
Is it too late for me to report this to the police? ( 21)
I know nothing about law or courts. I have never been in any sort of legal issues. How can I prepare? Any advice would help. ( 114)
What type of questions will be asked? And why does the fact that he has been charged not mean he's guilty? I find it all so confusing! ... I have requested to have screens up so I wont be able to see him in the court room which is a small positive but still, I am so anxious about what's to come. So any advice/experiences no matter how small will be much appreciated, thank you! (67)
These excerpts highlight that victim-survivors sought advice around how to best navigate the criminal justice system. Other victim-survivors wanted to know more about others experiences in the aftermath of sexual violence, particularly in recovery:
IJCJ&SD 52 Online version via www.crimejusticejournal.com Â© 2018 7(1) Does anyone have any advice for how to be less nervous all the time? â€¦ also does anyone have any advice for feeling less scared or angry when I see him? ( 42)
:( How long is this supposed to take so I'm not bothered by it anymore? (
I guess what I'm looking for here is advice on dealing with the rage. ( 86)
These victim-survivors, whilst clearly seeking support as well, also sought specific answers and strategies to help them cope with the emotional and psychological impacts of sexual violence. Many victim-survivors who posted to the forum had sought professional help through therapy, and this itself was something that they sought advice about: Anybody else feel more shame since getting therapy? ( 125)
For these victim-survivors, having professional support had not been enough, leading them to seek advice from an online community for a better response or for advice about to navigate relationships with their counsellor. Perhaps this indicates, as noted above, that having an audience of fellow victim-survivors to interact with is a significant motivator for some of those accessing /r/rapecounseling.
Similarly, many victim-survivors wanted to know if what they experienced during or in the aftermath of sexual violence was 'normal':
Sometimes I wake up and feel numb all over my body and never feel like getting out of bed. In about 3 months it will have been a year since the day it all happened.
How much longer will it take to feel normal again? Does anyone have tips that has helped them heal? (124)
My reason for posting here is that I want to hear that my reaction was normal (from what I've read of other people's experiences the 'freeze-response' is pretty common), and that I didn't cause my sexual assault. This is what I needed to hear from an objective professional, but lately it feels like he's[therapist] saying the opposite. ( 160)
These narratives highlight that, in the aftermath of sexual violence, victim-survivors' needs, including emotional reassurance, are not always met by formal structures that they access, such as therapy or the justice system. This is reflected in studies that have assessed victim-survivor justice needs (Herman, 2005;McGlynn et al. 2012). In a similar vein, numerous victim-survivors were uncertain about what 'counted' as sexual assault or rape and, as such, sought advice from the community. Some victim-survivors seemed to be struggling with understanding their experiences of sexual violence in the context of societal myths about rape; for example, whether rape can occur without physical violence or resistance, or be perpetrated by an intimate partner. One asked:
Can I really call myself a rape victim if I didn't do EVERYTHING possible to prevent him from having sex with me? (46)
He is my husband, I've had sex with him thousands of times, I just can't seem to see how that was rape. ( 131 It seems evident that some victim-survivors accessing /r/rapecounseling were seeking affirmation of some kind as to whether they had or had not experienced sexual violence. In another example, a male victim-survivor discussed struggling to name his experience as rape because it was perpetrated by a woman: I don't feel like I can call it sexual assault even though the hotline and my fiancÃ© say it was. I know men can be raped by women and I know it's never the victims fault, but I can't get myself to recognize that is true for me as well â€¦ I still feel like it's my fault. ( 163)
This perhaps indicates that a broader culture of victim blaming has a deep impact on survivors in the aftermath of sexual violence. Similarly, some victim-survivors also seemed to be seeking clarification around consent: This person seems to blame themselves for not saying no to sex while they were asleep, which is, legally, a consent-negating circumstance. /r/rapecounseling users would often respond to posts where victim-survivors sought clarification about their experiences by providing information about consent and consent-negating circumstances. /r/rapecounseling users would pick up on issues such as self-blame and encourage each other to recognise that sexual violence is never a victim's fault. Again, this suggests that online communities can provide victim-survivors with knowledge and support in the aftermath of sexual violence.
Storytelling: 'I just really needed to get it out'
Finally, victim-survivors are posting to /r/rapecounseling to share their stories. This section analyses how victim-survivors refer to their posts as 'stories', and in doing so, construct /r/rapecounseling as a community for storytelling. Survivors would discuss the importance of writing their experiences and sharing them:
I'm sorry this was such a long post, but I really wanted to type this out. It's been 10 years since I was raped, but I finally feel strong enough to put it into words. Baby steps. ( 148)
It took me a while to write this but I finally did. I don't know if anyone will read this but I'm just proud I was capable of talking about it, through writing at least. ( 161)
For these victim-survivors, it is not only the story that the /r/rapecounseling community hears and validates but also the act of storytelling. As seen in the quote above, some victim-survivors would apologise for the length of their story. However, it seems that the acknowledgement of length does not negate victim-survivors' needs to share their stories in the first place:
My story is long, fair warning â€¦ (41)
Please listen to me. This will have a long explanation. ( 58 Others noted that it had not been easy to post their story but, importantly, recognise that stories and the community as a whole gave them courage to speak: I've been reading this sub for a while, but I'm finally getting up the courage to try to talk about what happened to me and try to make sense of it. I'm sorry this is likely to be a long post. I'm going to change all names in this story. ( 63)
This victim-survivor has noted that their passive use (sometime",6864,7796

Objective: Sexual assault victims often do not disclose their assaults or seek positive health outcomes. The RAINN Survivor Stories project shares testimonials in the form of online blogs from sexual assault survivors to motivate and encourage others to come forward and disclose their assaults. This study aimed to better understand the themes present in the survivor stories to motivate victims to disclose their assaults and seek positive health outcomes. Design: A theoretical thematic analysis was conducted on blog posts created for the project to identify (a) how the posts tell survivor stories and (b) how the posts model positive health outcomes using social cognitive theory and the disclosure processes model as a guide. Setting: Online setting linked to the rainn.org website. Method: Blog posts were collected for inductive thematic analysis. Themes were identified based on their prevalence in the data and their pertinence to the research questions. Results: Emerging themes included (a) overcoming initial disclosure, (b) overcoming the lasting effects of victimisation, (c) utilising support and (d) advocating for others after assault. Conclusion: Findings offer insight to researchers and practitioners creating media messages for sexual assault victims and other stigmatised groups by expanding understanding of modelled positive health outcomes in media and the disclosure process of victims.

One in five women in the USA report having been raped (Smith et al., 2018), and almost 80% of female victims report that they were first raped before the age of 25 (Black et al., 2011). Men also experience sexual violence, with one in five men reporting that they have experienced unwanted sexual contact during their lifetime (Smith et al., 2018). These statistics only tell part of the story; due to stigma, many victims do not disclose their sexual assaults (Black et al., 2011). If individuals do not feel as though they can come forward to disclose information about their sexual assaults, then they may miss out on receiving mental and physical health care.
In 2016, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) launched a national blog campaign to encourage individuals affected by sexual assault to call the hotline or reach out to others for support, and work has continued on the project today (RAINN, 2016). Before researchers and practitioners can create successful media campaigns and projects that encourage disclosure and model positive health behaviours for sexual assault victims, it is important to understand the themes found in media content available to victims through the Internet. In this study, theoretical thematic analysis was used to analyse the themes in publicly available blog posts written for sexual assault victims informed by Bandura's (2001b) social cognitive theory and Chaudoir and Fisher's (2010) disclosure processes model (Braun and Clarke, 2006). Emerging themes were identified in 46 blog posts based on their importance and application to an understanding of positive health behaviour and disclosure among individuals living with stigmatised identities. Study findings contribute to discussion of how media messages can be crafted by researchers and practitioners to better reach stigmatised populations with concealable identities.
Sexual assault and health
Sexual assault is a vastly underreported crime. Approximately five out of six rape victims in the USA did not report their assault to the police (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2011). In addition, victim service agencies in the USA such as rape crisis centres only reach and support approximately one in four sexual assault victims (Planty et al., 2013).
It is unclear how many sexual assault victims are living in secret, as sexual assault is often underreported due to stigma (Fisher et al., 2003;Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2011). When a person is sexually assaulted, he or she may be forced to assume a stigmatised hidden identity, and this stigma can influence interpersonal relationships and self-identity, leading to potential further revictimisation and negative health outcomes (Chaudoir and Fisher, 2010;Miller et al., 2011;Quinn and Chaudoir, 2015). Perceived stigma, or self-stigma, is a significant predictor of negative mental health outcomes in sexual assault victims compared to cultural stereotypes and public stigma (Dietz et al., 2015). When sexual assault victims view themselves as not normal and lose their sense of self-worth, this can lead to worse psychological well-being (Dietz et al., 2015;Huemmer et al., 2019). Sexual assault victims may experience unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety (World Health Organization, 2003). If unaddressed, these physical and mental health issues may lead to high-risk behaviour including drug and alcohol use (World Health Organization, 2003).
Disclosure, the act of sharing information with others, is a crucial first step for individuals, including sexual assault victims, to begin the journey to recovery (Chaudoir and Fisher, 2010). When victims receive a negative response to their disclosure, they can experience negative health outcomes and cease to talk about their sexual assault (Ahrens et al., 2010;Campbell et al., 2001). Other barriers to disclosure include wanting to keep the incident secret, not having proof of the event, fearing retribution, anticipating negative responses from police, preferring to handle the matter privately, minimising the event, protecting the perpetrator and feeling uncertain whether the incident was a crime (Alaggia and Wang, 2020;Fisher et al., 2000;Sable et al., 2006). Survivors in the USA who were interviewed about their experiences said they were blamed for allowing themselves to be victimised, denied sympathy or compassion, refused help, or assisted by someone in an ineffective way after they disclosed their assaults to others (Ahrens, 2006). These negative reactions can prevent future disclosure, as victims lose faith in their ability to seek support or resources through disclosing (Ahrens, 2006). Victims who do not disclose their assault(s) are more likely than disclosers to report mental health issues like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (Ahrens et al., 2010).
When victims receive a positive response to their disclosure, they may find others who have similar experiences, and they may provide representation and awareness for others like them (Chaudoir and Fisher, 2010). These new social networks can be beneficial to helping sexual assault victims recover and find new supportive relationships (Chaudoir and Fisher, 2010;Dietz et al., 2015). Victims have described positive disclosure experiences as helping them feel supported, comforted and confirmed in their understanding that what happened to them was wrong (Ahrens et al., 2007).
The disclosure of health information online can be an effective tool for health practitioners to promote positive health behaviours (Alaggia and Wang, 2020;Pavelko et al., 2017). The #metoo movement has highlighted how viewing disclosures online can encourage individuals to disclose themselves, including when individuals experience barriers to disclosure (Alaggia and Wang, 2020). In addition, disclosures online can help individuals make sense of and seek out more information about their situations (Alaggia and Wang, 2020;Pavelko et al., 2017). An analysis of social media comments following Hugh Jackman's cancer diagnosis in 2013 revealed that individuals who read Jackman's disclosure online also commented that they might be more receptive to viewing more health messages and learning more information about cancer (Pavelko et al., 2017). Similarly, comments sections in social media posts that contain disclosures of sexual abuse may prompt others to share messages of offered social support and reciprocal disclosure, especially if the original discloser requested support in his or her initial post (Andalibi et al., 2018). Social media campaigns such as those associated with the #metoo movement or mental health outreach groups can lessen perceptions of stigma for individuals by providing observations of others disclosing their sexual abuse or mental health concerns (Andalibi et al., 2018;Smith-Frigerio, 2020).
Blogs, especially blogs that share personal and emotional narratives, can also be a useful avenue for disseminating persuasive health messages (Neubaum and KrÃ¤mer, 2015). One study found that individuals exposed to a blog with person-centred narratives about HIV were more likely to view condom use positively compared to individuals who were exposed to a blog that did not contain person-centred narratives (Neubaum and KrÃ¤mer, 2015). In another study, blog posts containing a narrative about skin cancer led to increased narrative transportation and increased positive behavioral intentions for readers compared to a non-narrative blog post (Stavrositu and Kim, 2015). Chaudoir and Fisher's (2010) disclosure processes model describes the steps that are made by individuals living with concealable stigmatised identities when they decide to disclose information about their identity to another person. Even though the signs of victimisation are often concealed, the anticipated negative responses from others can be barriers to disclosure and cause stress, impacting overall well-being (Quinn and Chaudoir, 2015). During a disclosure event, the response of the person who is receiving the information is important in encouraging future disclosure (Chaudoir and Fisher, 2010). Disclosure is important for individuals with concealable stigmatised identities, including the victims of sexual assault, because by disclosing they can access support and information that they would not otherwise have (Chaudoir and Fisher, 2010).
Theoretical framework
Media messages can provide useful models of positive health behaviour, like disclosure, for sexual assault victims by modelling positive outcomes and promoting self-efficacy (Bandura, 2001b(Bandura, , 2004). Bandura's (2001b) social cognitive theory describes how media creates a symbolic environment that shapes thoughts, behaviours and attitudes. Media can influence health behaviours by modelling effective health practices so individuals feel they can control their own outcomes (Bandura, 2004). Through media, individuals can learn about positive health practices, see the practice in action, see the result and feel more confident that they themselves can demonstrate the same behaviour (Bandura, 2004).
Self-efficacy refers to individuals' perceptions of their confidence in their own abilities to execute a behaviour (Bandura, 1982). Bandura (2001a) describes imposed environments as contexts where individuals have little agency in controlling environmental factors. When individuals experience sexual assault, they are forced into an environment where they must make sense of their new stigmatised identity and cope with trauma. Nevertheless, individuals have some agency to seek outcomes for themselves in any environment (Bandura, 2001a). Media with salient self-efficacious messages could serve an important role in encouraging victims to see themselves as beings with agency who can take action to better themselves. When individuals feel self-efficacious, they set more lofty but attainable goals for themselves and change their perceptions of the outcomes they expect from certain health behaviours (Bandura, 2004). Research has found that messages that encourage self-efficacy can affect individuals' perceived self-efficacy (Brown et al., 1997;Keller, 2006).
Informed by these theoretical approaches, this study analysed the RAINN Survivor Stories project guided by the following research questions: RQ1: (How) do the blog posts discuss the experiences of sexual assault victims; and RQ2: (How) do the blog posts include messages aimed to encourage sexual assault victims to disclose their assault(s) and seek positive health behaviours?
Method

Data
The data analysed consisted of text-based blog posts (n = 46) written for the RAINN Survivor Stories project which are publicly available and highly visible on the project website.
In each blog post, a survivor of sexual assault or domestic abuse tells her or his story and offers encouragement to others who are considering disclosing their sexual assault. Out of the 46 blog posts analysed, 8 of the blog posts featured the narratives of men. Blog posts had an average word count of 843 words and were written in a feature writing-type style with quotes from the survivors weaved through the recounting of the survivors' stories. Although the blog posts do not disclose the date published, the blogs were likely posted between the inception of the campaign in 2016 and the time of data collection in late 2019. Links to a national hotline for victims of sexual assault and other resources are embedded throughout the posts.
Data analysis
Theoretical thematic analysis was conducted on the 46 blog posts created for the RAINN Survivor Stories project. After I familiarised myself with the dataset and coded the data, I identified emergent themes by the prevalence of codes in the dataset and the relevance of the theme to the research questions (Braun and Clarke, 2006). From there, I reviewed and refined the themes to create a thematic map of the data, selecting exemplars that best illustrate the theme (Braun and Clarke, 2006).
Findings
The intent of the blog posts, to motivate victims to disclose their sexual assault(s) and seek positive health outcomes, seems ever-present in the Survivor Stories project. The following four themes emerged in relation to how the blog posts told the stories of victims and encouraged positve health behavior: (a) overcoming the initial disclosure, (b) overcoming the lasting effects of victimisation, (c) utilising support systems and (d) advocating after assault.
Overcoming the initial disclosure
Survivors were often anxious about their initial disclosure to family and friends because they felt they would not be believed. For example, Julianna kept her abuse a secret 'fearing that she would upset her mother who was so happy to be married to her new husband'. When Julianna finally disclosed to her mother that her stepfather had abused her, her mother did not believe her. Similarly, Carolyn described feeling anxious about disclosing to her Hispanic family because sexual assault is 'something you do not talk about'. She said: 'I was really nervous to tell my parents because I didn't know what they would think of me. I was scared they wouldn't believe me and would think I was lying'. Both Julianna and Carolyn disclosed to their family despite these barriers. Carolyn said: I want people to know that even if it feels like the end and you don't want to deal with it anymore, even if you feel like you don't deserve anything in life -you aren't going to feel like this forever. It will pass.
Cultural understandings and family relationships are just some of the factors contributing to a victim feeling as if he or she will not be believed. The 'burden of proof' surrounding sexual assault, according to Tara, creates a 'your word vs the other person's word' type of situation. She added:
You just think, why should I say anything because no one is going to believe me, I'm wasting my time . . . You want to say something, but worry that when you do, it could come back worse. I think that's why a lot of people don't report.
Despite this, Tara shared that it is important to talk about the experience with others, and she participated in a photoshoot for victims, stating: 'I ended up doing it just to show my own self that no matter what happened in the past, you can overcome it'.
Male survivors seemed to be strongly concerned about not being believed due to norms around masculinity. Adam did not tell anyone about his assault for 10 years because he feared he would not be believed, saying: 'I think there's a stigma attached to that, ""Oh, you're a man, you should have been able to fend him off""'. Another male survivor, Scott, added that in addition to not being believed, he was threatened by his abuser. Support from family, friends and counsellors was helpful to both Adam and Scott following their disclosure. Scott shared: 'My guidance counsellor through high school looked out for me and understood my struggle'.
The fear of losing control or being defined by the experience seemed to be significant barriers for some survivors. Jeanette 'didn't want to feel like a victim or let anything get in the way of her goals'. She was able to gain back some of her control through running: 'Running became a day-byday healing process for me'. Like Jeanette, Hannah described not wanting 'this experience to define me', and finally disclosed to her parents that she had been assaulted after 7 years due to the strain it placed on her relationship with her parents.
Overcoming the lasting effects of victimisation
The journey after victimisation is burdened with hardship, including physical and mental health issues and relational issues with family and friends. Almost all blog posts mentioned physical and mental health problems experienced after an assault in some way. Common mental health issues referenced by blog posts included anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and panic attacks. At first, Cheryl did not understand her mental illness symptoms:
It was impacting my day-to-day life so significantly, and I didn't understand why. I didn't understand the connection. I had a happy life. I was married with kids, a house, and a job . . . and I was still having panic attacks.
Tasha also experienced mental health problems following her abuse, including feeling anxious when friends did not respect her boundaries:
It makes me anxious because it reminds me of the assault -of my 'no' being ignored. I just take a breath, gather my thoughts, and explain to that person why what they did was particularly difficult for me.
Both Cheryl and Tasha found support for their mental illness through therapy or counselling to recognise symptoms and triggers. Tasha described how, at first, she did not want to attend support groups or go to counselling, but later, she found it helpful to talk to others.
Physical health issues mentioned throughout the blog posts included many physical symptoms of mental illness, such as losing or gaining weight, losing sleep, binge-drinking and cutting or other self-harming behaviours. Tiffany's mental state following her abuse caused noticeable physical symptoms, including sudden weight loss and a decline in her skating ability: 'I would come home from practice and turn off the lights and sleep until dinner. I felt depressed. I felt terrible'. Similarly, Katie developed an eating disorder after her assault that caused her to lose 'half of my body weight in nine months'. She said: 'People think it is about being pretty. It wasn't about wanting to be attractive, it was about destroying myself. It was about wanting to die'.
Together, the stories told by survivors featured in this project suggested the gravity of their victimisation. Although survivors do not choose to experience the physical and mental health issues that followed their assault, they have still had to confront these issues and seemed confident in their ability to forge a new path and create a new normal for themselves.
Utilising support systems
Access to social support including friends and family, and access to professional help for mental illness, seem key to helping survivors overcome obstacles. Many talked highly of the people who supported them first and encouraged them in the early stages of their recovery. Lea described the importance of finding social support:
There is absolutely nothing as helpful as a good network of friends. Friends, in particular, who understand and respect your lived experiences and can offer compassion and perspective -without judgement.
Leilani's Indigenous culture helped guide her through her recovery process, including finding social support. She shared:
In Pasifika culture there is a concept called talanoa, which means binding together through sharing. It's a practice of finding language to describe your experiences and reconnecting to your community. This practice was integral to my healing: it showed me that I was capable of shaping my own narrative and identity. I am an active participant in my own story.
Johnathon's initial disclosure that he had been assaulted was not a positive experience and caused him to keep the assault a secret until he became sick with a sexually transmitted infection because of the assault. A female roommate was there to help him. Johnathan said: 'She was the supportive person I needed. She was the angel who helped me begin my recovery'. Adam had a similar experience to Johnathan; he was afraid that he would not be believed or that his disclosure of sexual abuse would cause harm, but when he finally disclosed to his family, he was supported 'unconditionally'. Adam said: 'It is important to have a supportive group of friends and family to be your rock. I think it worked for me because I was able to talk about the abuse to a supportive group of people'.
Professional help for mental illness such as counselling or therapy was seen as an important aspect of healing. Almost every blog post in the project referenced some form of professional help as a part of the survivor's recovery process. Marissa explained how her experiences with her therapist were 'essential'. Marissa said: 'Therapy was helpful for working out how I felt about what happened to me and what I wanted to do about it. Putting it down on paper and reading it back to myself was really powerful for me'.
Survivors described their experiences with different kinds of therapy. Carolyn described her experiences with one-on-one and group counselling, using dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT), a technique that helps people learn skills in mindfulness and emotional regulation: 'I would recommend DBT to survivors out there; I saw a lot of survivors in that class. It's been very important to me'. Erin echoed this sentiment: 'Talk therapy with a trauma-informed therapist is so crucial. I tried other forms of therapy, but they didn't get it'.
Many survivors suggested that finding a good counsellor or therapist took time. Eileen recommended to others that they should 'interview several therapists to find the right one'. Jeannette referred to finding a therapist as a 'process, but it's a worthwhile one'. Lacy described her struggle to find a therapist that understood her cultural background and her experiences as a victim:
It took me a couple tries to find a therapist I liked. The first few didn't understand my cultural background coming from an Asian family. Then I found an amazing therapist who helped me validate my feelings and sift through what I should let go of.
Advocating after assault
The structure of the blog posts allows the reader to follow a journey from beginning to end. At the end of each blog post, the survivor describes her or his life now, including their career, family life and advocacy work.
Brian described life after assault by saying: 'I'm on this road to wellbeing. The fact that I keep taking each step makes me stronger'. While some survivors were able to construct a somewhat normal life despite their victimisation, others were influenced by their experience to advocate for others. Natalie, who now has a master's degree in public health and works as a volunteer for the National Sexual Assault Hotline, said:
There is power in local advocacy. It can include supporting people you know who have been assaulted, helping them get access to services, and helping them with education. Eliminating a lot of the stigma, that's huge.
Many of the survivors featured in this project are members of the RAINN Speakers Bureau, a group of 4,000 survivors located throughout the USA (RAINN Speakers Bureau, n. d.). Members of the Bureau go to events and speak to the media about their experiences. Monica described doing so as a healing experience: 'When I joined the RAINN Speakers Bureau . . . I was around people who I knew who would support me, honor me, and give me a voice'.
Other survivors involved in the project published books and memoirs of their experiences to encourage others. Lisa described the following reasons for writing books about her experience: I want to prepare people for how to respond to someone who decides to share these personal and intimate details. Some people find it very hard to handle your hurt. They don't want to hear about it because they don't know how to cope with it.
Several survivors focused on advocacy for university students who were the victims of sexual assault on campus. Lucy's advocacy work involved fighting for justice in her sexual assault case over a 10-year period. She said: 'The amount of back-and-forth, waiting for returned phone calls, leaving messages, reading about the law, trying to find information and answers, it was totally exhausting'. Lucy continued:
What keeps me going is knowing that I'm doing this on behalf of so many women out there who do not have justice. I just want to keep telling them, if we don't keep hitting the wall, the wall won't come down.
Another example of advocacy can be found in Maya's story, which was first featured in The Hunting Ground, a documentary discussing the problem of sexual assault on US college campuses. Maya is now researching gender equity issues in graduate school and leading a student organisation to raise awareness of sexual abuse at her university. Finally, Tasha has worked to make sure that resources on college campuses, such as the Title IX office, are functioning properly and their services are well promoted: 'For instance, if a campus claims to have a late-night security escort back to residence halls from the library, it has to be a reliable and functional service'.
While some survivors had sought not to become vocal advocates for sexual violence prevention through advocacy or book writing, all survivors seem willing to share their stories as they lived their lives. Megan was assaulted when she was serving in the armed forces and still talks to other members of the military community:
The more I speak out, the more positive responses I get. I hear from people all the time that this happened to (their) wife, partner, or mom. It made me realize, I'm not the only one with this skeleton in the closet.
Finally, some survivors have used their story as a form of advocacy through direct appeals to victims and to friends and family of victims. Kassie ended her account with the following quote: 'You should tell somebody. It doesn't matter who; go to a friend, mom, dad. If you can't report it to the police, tell someone you trust'. Lilly described how the family and friends of an individual suffering domestic abuse should help them create a plan to stay safe: 'The biggest priority is making sure that the person who is being abused understands that this isn't safe, and that you support them'.
Discussion
This study identified four themes that described how blog posts discussed the diverse experiences of victims and encouraged victims to disclose their experiences of sexual assault. Overall, the blog posts provided a platform on which survivors could share their experiences of sexual assault while encouraging the development of healthy behaviours, including disclosure, for victims of sexual assault. Messages stressing self-efficacy and modelling positive health behaviours were present in almost every blog post and in the themes identified in this analysis. Testimonials offered support for key aspects of Chaudoir and Fisher's (2010) disclosure process model for individuals living with concealable stigmatised identities, including how individuals considered their disclosure and navigated relationships before and after the disclosure event.
First, the blog posts focused on survivor narratives of overcoming sexual assault victimisation by using support systems and becoming an advocate for others. Although it is not possible to encompass the sum-total of individual experiences in approximately 800 words, the blog posts discussed the experiences of survivors openly, with a clear focus on the person's journey and voice. The 46 survivors featured in the Survivor Stories project described their struggles and openly disclosed information about their physical and mental health that were a result of their victimisation. Although some survivors may still struggle, through their determination, their use of support, and their willingness to speak out, all the survivors in the project seemed to be on a journey to recovery.
Second, the blog posts seemed to model disclosure as a positive health behaviour for both sexual assault victims and the friends and family of victims through an emphasis on self-efficacy. Self-efficacy, a key tenet of Bandura's (2001aBandura's ( , 2001b)); social cognitive theory, was present in each of the themes identified in this analysis. Information online about positive health behaviours such as disclosure is particularly important because it is 'readily available, convenient, and provides a feeling of anonymity' (Bandura, 2004: 150). When this information also includes messages that explicitly encourage self-efficacy, blog posts can become persuasive tools to help sexual assault victims.
The blog posts seem to model disclosure as a positive health behaviour throughout their narratives and salient self-efficacy messages. When survivors in the project discussed how they overcame barriers to initial disclosure, dealt with struggles that were the result of their victimisation, and reached out for social support, they modelled self-efficacy to others. The posts also include quotes from survivors directed specifically at readers who might be victims to encourage them to be self-efficacious in disclosing details of their sexual assault. In addition, the blog posts seemed to model helpful behaviour for individuals who wanted to learn more about helping sexual assault victims. Often the blog posts included quotes from survivors offering advice about how to talk to sexual assault victims to reduce barriers to disclosure.
The blog posts also suggest that involvement in advocacy may be an important step on the journey from victim to survivor. When individuals disclose information about their concealable stigmatised identity, not only do they open themselves up to receive social support, but they also contribute to the dismantling of stigma socially and culturally (Brashers et al., 2002;Chaudoir and Fisher, 2010). Each disclosure can increase visibility of an otherwise concealed identity, which may reduce stigma and make it easier for future disclosure for others (Chaudoir and Fisher, 2010). When individuals read the blog posts of individuals who have made it from victim to advocate, this modelled behaviour may motivate disclosure on the individual level and contribute to the dismantling of stigma for others.
Implications
Taken together, research findings provide lessons for practitioners using media to motivate positive health behaviour from victims of sexual assault. The themes documented here signal the importance of self-efficacy and modelled behaviour in media content for victims of sexual assault. In addition, the themes suggest involvement in advocacy may be an important step in the journey from victim to survivor.
Identification, or the ability to emphasise with the perspective of media characters, is an important factor in the persuasiveness of media campaigns (Brown, 2015;Cohen, 2001). The fact that each blog post focuses on one story gives readers the chance to find a narrator with whom they share a common experience. The breadth of experiences of victimisation featured in the project, including representation of diverse gender identities, means that a wide audience of readers can find a survivor narrative tailored to their experience. Blog posts featuring specific storytellers may appeal to many different subsets of victims by encouraging identification, but more research is needed to understand this relationship.
Limitations
This study is not without its limitations. More research is needed to understand the effects of persuasive media on individuals in similar and unrelated contexts. While findings from the study may be of value to researchers and practitioners, the results are not generalisable to other health media campaigns for sexual assault victims. Although RAINN is a major nonprofit organisation, future research should explore media campaigns and health messages encouraging disclosure by a wider range of nonprofit organisations, both in the USA and internationally.
Research is also needed to understand the influence of different types of media campaigns and the different message features present in blogs. Video blogs may have a greater influence than written blogs in influencing the development of self-efficacy (Shen et al., 2015). Future research is needed to examine the effectiveness of survivor narratives presented in text, audio and visual formats in facilitating recovery and survivorship from sexual assault victims. The effect of different message features, including the use of narrative format and comments sections, is also worthy of examination (Stavrositu and Kim, 2015).
Conclusion
The RAINN Survivor Stories project provided a platform for survivors to share narratives about their journey after sexual assault victimisation, from initial disclosure to living a life of advocacy. The importance of self-efficacy was present in each of the four themes, suggesting its importance in tandem with modelled positive health behaviour in future media campaigns encouraging disclosure from sexual assault victims. Engagement in advocacy efforts may provide one way in which the victims of sexual assault can receive support and model positive behaviour for others.",6351,7135
