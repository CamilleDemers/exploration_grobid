Continuing professional development is a necessary aspect of keeping up to date in a rapidly changing profession. Librarians are no more immune to evolutions in technology and innovation, service provision and customer expectations than any other professional group. This paper explores the current New Zealand setting and context of CPD for librarians, and discusses the outcomes of a CPD Needs Assessment conducted in 2005 for this sector of the information society. Findings include the key topics, delivery methods, and other factors seen as important by librarians and their managers. Differences between types of libraries, and between librarians' and their managers' views, are noted.

T he mAiNteNANce Of prOfessiONAl educAtiON, stANdArds ANd prActice is usuAlly dependent on some form of continuing professional development (CPD). This applies to information professionals, including librarians, no less than any other profession. CPD has been defined as 'the continuing education of persons within a category or type of employment. It may consist of the upgrading of skills or learning through courses or individual learning. Where professions have expanded, professional development may involve doing new courses...' (Penguin Macquarie dictionary of Australian education 1989). There are many writers on the subject of CPD, and it is apparent that it may be interpreted and practised in many different ways. This paper focuses on librarians and their CPD needs within the New Zealand context, reporting on research undertaken in 2005.
Identifying what CPD is needed by librarians will be dependent on interpretation. There may be differences between what is thought of as 'CPD' by practitioners, employers, education providers, and professional associations; and as a result, discrepancies and apparent failures to meet needs or expectations can arise. However, there is no doubt about the importance of CPD: '… the shelf life of a degree is approximately three years and declining. Maintaining competence and learning new skills must be at the top of every professional' s ""To Do"" list. It is an ethical responsibility ... but also one that is pragmatic and critical for career success.' (Weingand 1999).
The mission of this research was to identify the CPD needs of librarians in New Zealand. The impetus was threefold: firstly, there was no current overview of the CPD needs of librarians in New Zealand, and so a gap in awareness was identified. Secondly, investigations were being made by The Open Polytechnic of New Zealand into areas additional to the teaching of their core programs in Information and Library Studies, and CPD was identified as such a possible area for development. Thirdly, after this research was begun an additional impetus was given when LIANZA (Library and Information Association of New Zealand Aotearoa) took the first steps towards professional registration of librarians in New Zealand and established a taskforce to investigate the issue (LIANZA 2005b). One of the taskforce' s initial recommendations was for 'the establishment of a continuing professional development framework for registered members' (LIANZA Taskforce on Professional Registration 2005: 4). This research aimed to establish in detail what the CPD needs of the profession were. The research was conducted by staff from the Information and Library Studies section of The Open Polytechnic of New Zealand, under the auspices of LIANZA.
The process was to examine the relevant literature, look at the New Zealand context, and conduct a CPD Needs Assessment of librarians to determine and evaluate their needs. The Needs Assessment took the form of a survey widely distributed to the library community. Selected results are outlined below.
Literature review
Niemi provides a useful framework for considering professional development, suggesting that professionals seek educational opportunities from four sources: institutions of higher education, professional associations, independent (proprietary) agencies, and the agencies which employ these professionals, but notes that this last source is more likely to be concerned with the needs of the organisation than the needs of the professional (Niemi 1996: 72). To this can be added more informally constituted and organic communities of practice, such as mentoring, mailing lists and web logs (blogs). Few studies into the area of CPD for librarians have been undertaken in New Zealand. Two recent studies conducted in the areas of information management consultants and contractors, and of records managers, are discussed below. Evidence of the need for CPD is also discussed.
A study of consultants and contractors in the information industry in New Zealand was conducted in 2001, covering librarians, records managers, archivists, information managers and knowledge managers (Fields 2003). Although this study covered only one sector of the information industry, trends identified may be similar to those in other sectors. The study sought to identify how this group operates, and among the wide range AugusT 2006 Keeping the roses watered: the continuing professional development of librarians in New Zealand of questions asked were some on qualifications, professional standards and support. In its findings, it was noted that there already exist many opportunities for professional development and support for this group, and that it was largely the responsibility of the individual to find and make use of the existing services. The most commonly used forms of CPD were professional reading, professional mailing lists, conferences, networking, professional associations, meetings, speakers and other opportunities.
Records managers were surveyed in 2002 to determine what kinds of qualifications they had, and what kinds of CPD or substitutions for qualifications they had completed or acquired (Cossham 2004a). Participation in continuing education (defined in the survey as short courses, workshops, seminars, conferences, training, etc) varied enormously. There was a wide range of events listed including courses from tertiary institutions, generic business skills and computer courses, Archives New Zealand training courses, professional associations' conferences, meetings and workshops, courses offered by consultants, websites, professional reading and mailing lists, and networking. Records managers also made good use of in-house and employer-provided training, such as computer application training, business and management skills and HR courses, Te Reo Maori (Maori language), biculturalism and the Treaty of Waitangi. This relates closely to Niemi' s assertion that while agencies employing professionals provide continuing education, it is more likely to be concerned with the needs of the organisation than the needs of the professional. It is also noted that for the individual, both organisational needs and personal needs are relevant. (Cossham 2004a: 32).
LIANZA' s monthly journal, Library Life: Te rau Ora, published an issue devoted to professional development in December 2000. It looked at both qualifications and CPD; one article examined the state of CPD in New Zealand and the establishment and initial work of the then Professional Development Standing Committee, but asked more questions than it answered (Tocker 2000).
Other evidence of the need and use for CPD has been gathered from students in The Open Polytechnic' s undergraduate courses, many of whom are upgrading their qualifications, frequently from a perceived need to up-skill; and from stakeholders consulted in the process of developing new courses, such as the Certificate in Cataloguing. There is also considerable interest in some of the new subjects and courses being made available; from prospective and current students, from those with existing qualifications, and also from employers.
The New Zealand setting and conditions
The number of people currently working within information management is difficult to quantify. In library contexts in New Zealand, while 2001 census figures show that while there are 6027 people working in this area (New Zealand librarian labour market 2005), there are only 1244 individual and 459 institutional members of LIANZA. (LIANZA 2005a). Formal education opportunities for librarians exist with qualifications available through The Open Polytechnic of New Zealand, Victoria University of Wellington, The Auckland College of Education and Te Wananga-O-Raukawa. Opportunities available to allied fields such as records managers and archivists have been more scattered until recently when courses were established at The Open Polytechnic of New Zealand (2001) and Victoria University of Wellington (2005).
There are a variety of CPD offerings available to librarians in New Zealand, but these have tended to be supplier rather than market-driven, offered in a piecemeal fashion, and differ from year to year and from region to region. To date there has been no formal requirement by LIANZA for librarians to undertake CPD in order to achieve or maintain professional status, although this may change when the LIANZA Taskforce on Professional Registration has completed its work. This means the CPD landscape is likely to undergo some form of restructuring following the outcome and implementation of the Taskforce' s recommendations.
The changing impetus towards CPD
There are a number of factors that have coloured CPD choices, and these are likely to cause more changes in the immediate future. Firstly, the range of CPD options is fluid, as is the marketplace in which they are set. The amount, type, and subjects of CPD available to the profession often change, as do the providers. Secondly, recent government initiatives such as the National Digital Strategy bring new tasks, challenges, and information skills to be learned and passed on. Thirdly, the LIANZA Taskforce on Professional Registration is yet to make its recommendations, which will inevitably affect the way CPD is undertaken by the profession.
Looking firstly at what is currently available for librarians in NZ, we see that a wide range of CPD opportunities already exist, and the options can be categorised according to Niemi' s framework. Institutions of higher learning such as The Open Polytechnic of New Zealand and Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) offer formal courses leading to undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications (respectively). LIANZA provides, hosts, develops or organises a wide variety of CPD, including conferences. Each of the LIANZA regional and special interest groups also develops, organises or hosts some CPD each year but the quantity and quality of this varies. Institutions which employ librarians also undertake a range of training courses which can be classed as CPD. These may focus on industry-specific or discipline-related subjects and courses such as information technology skills or relating to customers. Beyond Niemi' s framework are the 'communities of practice' which may evolve their own CPD offerings as need and opportunity arises. Mailing lists and web logs come into this category, as do networking and maintaining industry contacts, professional reading, research and writing, and mentoring.
Secondly, other recent initiatives will have an impact on the type and nature of CPD opportunities for librarians. Both central and local government have recently launched e-government strategies. The goal of the central government strategy was that by 2004 the public sector in New Zealand would work as a single, integrated operation (E-government in New Zealand 2003). Building on this, in 2004 the National Digital Strategy was written and put out for consultation (Digital Strategy 2004). The strategy' s vision is that: New Zealand will be a world leader at using information and technology to realise our economic, social and cultural goals. All New Zealanders will benefit from the power of information and communications technology (ICT) to harness information for economic and social gain. This will result in changes in government, businesses, communities and society as a whole. (Digital Strategy 2004: 6) The key areas of emphasis include improving access to New Zealand content, such as national heritage collections and government information, developing the digital confidence and capability of all New Zealanders and ensuring the ICT environment is trusted, secure and reliable, supporting grassroots developments to build the ICT AugusT 2006
Keeping the roses watered: the continuing professional development of librarians in New Zealand capability of communities, increasing the potential of ICT to create value for businesses in all sectors, and using ICT to improve the delivery of government (Digital Strategy 2004). This highlights a need for sound information literacy, ICT skills, and for ensuring the right people are developing the required skills in order to deliver both the end product to the end user, and to produce the digital content and the extensive connection required (Draft National Digital Strategy, nd). This provides an environment where CPD can be effectively used to raise the existing skill base to help fulfil these government initiatives.
Lastly, the LIANZA Taskforce on Professional Registration will inevitably have an impact on CPD, but the extent of this will not be known until after the recommendations of the Taskforce have been made, accepted and implemented.
Methodology
The approach used was to develop a specific assessment tool using similar studies, surveys, other literature and ideas, as a basis. Work first began in October 2004 when academic staff in Information and Library Studies at The Open Polytechnic of New Zealand conducted a SWOT analysis of CPD for librarians, records managers and archivists. It was decided to focus on librarians as a target group, and the research plan was mapped out.
An examination of the current state of play of CPD in New Zealand was conducted, providing details of the existing CPD environment and offerings (Cossham et al 2005). Extensive networking was also undertaken within various professional associations active in information management. The researchers met with key personnel from LIANZA in November 2004 to explore opportunities for CPD within the profession. Both parties saw the benefits of conducting a CPD needs assessment, and so a Memorandum of Understanding was written, outlining the rights and responsibilities of each party, for the Needs Assessment to be conducted by The Open Polytechnic under the auspices of LIANZA.
The questions in the Needs Assessment were carefully worded to collect the data required, to show trends, and common ideas and needs, while maintaining confidentiality for individual respondents. Approval was sought and granted from The Open Polytechnic' s Ethics Committee. The Needs Assessment was then pre-tested by a group of librarians from all sectors of the profession, and went to LIANZA for comment. The Polytechnic' s Analyst Programmer, Peter Bagnato, developed a sophisticated web form for the Needs Assessment, which allowed for ranked multiple choices within some questions, and for initial data collation to be done electronically.
The Needs Assessment ran from 21 September to 12 October 2005. This was advertised initially as two weeks, with an additional week given for those involved in school holidays (particularly school librarians) and other projects. Information about the needs assessment and a hotlink to the survey itself went to librarians in a number of ways, including websites, mailing lists (nz-libs, law-lib, various SIG mailing lists, and other appropriate groups such as Te Roopu Whakahau: Maori in Libraries and Information Management), and e-journals. The aim was to reach as many librarians in all library types and all stages of career in as short a time as feasible. Primary data analysis was then undertaken by the researchers' faculty colleague, Lois Curry. The key findings are discussed below.

Keeping the roses watered: the continuing professional development of librarians in New Zealand
Findings and discussion
All figures have been rounded to the nearest half a percentage point. Not all respondents answered each question. There were 629 respondents. Once duplicates were removed (identified primarily by identical comments but also including one large block of 48 'barest minimum/default' sequential and identical responses) there were 573 useable responses. This is estimated to be around 9.5 per cent of the population of practising librarians in NZ (c.6000). 27.5 per cent of respondents do not belong to any professional association, while 55.5 per cent belong to LIANZA. This represents 25.5 per cent of the personal members of LIANZA, which is a very positive response.
The respondents were largely qualified: only 13.5 per cent had no qualification (sadly many seemed unable to identify whether they had undergraduate or postgraduate qualifications and had selected, and specified, 'Other'.) 34 per cent (of 454 responses) had qualified more than 15 years ago. Most of the respondents were from larger cities (69.5 per cent), while 8 per cent came from rural areas or 'other', and 22.5 per cent from towns/small cities. A range of types of libraries was well represented among the respondents as indicated below. When responses supplied and detailed in the 'Other' category are redistributed across the categories to which they actually belong, the third column is generated. Again, it was disappointing to find that some respondents were unable to identify their library' s sector. This range of library types represents the main groups within the library industry, and provides an overall view of the general CPD needs of the wider profession. Given the relatively small numbers of respondents from some groups, care has been taken to ensure that their preferences do not outweigh the preferences of the larger respondents, especially as in the long term this research may be used to determine the CPD actually offered by various providers, particularly LIANZA.
Respondents were asked to identify their personal CPD needs by topic over the next 2-3 years. Twenty-four topics were listed for respondents to choose from, based on major library functions and services, and personal issues (such as time management and customer service). There was also opportunity for additional responses under an 'Other (please specify)' category. Unsurprisingly, topics associated with electronic resources and information technology scored highly as 'very important' (71 per cent and 66 per cent respectively), with reference skills (55 per cent), information literacy (53 per cent), research (49 per cent), communication skills and user education (both 44 per cent) coming next highest. Strategies for developing a personal CPD plan, digitisation projects, and management skills also scored highly as 'very important'. (See Table 4 for a full listing). Correlating topics with library types led to some predictable responses with, for example, children' s services being rated highly by public and school librarians but not by special librarians. However information literacy was selected as either very important or important by high numbers of respondents in all library sectors, which was unexpected.
There were about 40 'other' CPD topics specified by respondents, including 'how to manage a staff member with psychopathic tendencies'; 'visits to public libraries'; training and teaching skills; leadership, strategic planning and project management; 'knowledge and information management'. One commented: 'My CPD interests are primarily about the hows and whys; I'm not interested in task-centred CPD, except where it fits into the larger intellectual picture'.
Respondents were also asked to identify their preferences for factors affecting CPD, including methods of delivery. For the latter, preferences were overwhelmingly given for short courses (half or full day), contact teaching (rather than distance, self-study or modular) and through attending presentations or interactive workshops rather than online or personal reading. Given the numbers who also indicated that assistance in planning their own CPD programs was very important (39 per cent) or important (38 per cent), this could indicate that the straightforward, quick options were the most favoured, and that CPD which helps individuals to develop their own strategies may be worth considering, especially in the light of the variation in offerings in different parts of the country and from year to year.
In questions relating to CPD presentation, content was considered 'very important' by most respondents, considerably in advance of the quality, availability, timeliness, cost or location of what was offered. There seemed to be no pattern to whether particular geographical areas or types of libraries preferred particular types of CPD. Most respondents (88 per cent) located information about CPD via listservs or electronic
The AusTrAliAn librAry JournAl AugusT 2006
Keeping the roses watered: the continuing professional development of librarians in New Zealand mailing lists. However, this is not surprising since this was the primary method of distributing this needs assessment, and so it is reasonable to assume that respondents have a higher level of awareness and use of this method of information dissemination. Gaining information about forthcoming CPD events via professional associations also scored highly, with 67 per cent of respondents gaining information about CPD via their professional association.
Questions were also asked about the importance respondents attached to CPD, and whether they were supported by their organisation to attend. Personal satisfaction was the most frequently selected reason for attending CPD, followed by preparation for a desired position, and salary increase. 82.5 per cent were encouraged by their employer to participate in CPD, and this employer support took the form of paid time to attend (70 per cent) and course fees paid (67 per cent). However, one respondent commented: 'Employer reluctance is the biggest factor in not attending. Also the employer and I differ in what training we think I need.' This sentiment was echoed in other comments. Budgets appeared to be tight (unsurprisingly), and the sharing of limited money between large numbers of staff was also an issue.
Managers were asked to provide additional information about their organisation' s focus on CPD and the requirements of their staff, as well as their own CPD needs. Around 120 responses were received from managers (varying in number from question to question), and some of the responses are not encouraging. Only 41.5 per cent said that their library had a well-defined CPD policy and this was evenly distributed across all the library types responding. However, 88 per cent also said they had a budget to cover CPD participation. There were 87 comments about the CPD policy (or situation, where no policy existed) from managers, which indicated that there is a range of practices from the reactive to the highly planned and actively supported. A number commented on the lack of interest by junior staff in CPD, either because they 'do not seek to extend themselves in a professional capacity' or because they do not ask: 'I think they think the library management team gets priority'. Some noted that the focus in their wider organisation was on training, rather than professional development, and one that 'while we actively encourage training …with excellent conditions to support training, the majority of our staff have AugusT 2006 Keeping the roses watered: the continuing professional development of librarians in New Zealand been here for a very long time and are reluctant to take on anything new. The majority are unqualified and see working in a library as ""just a job"" and not as a ""profession"".' Managers' preferences for CPD which they thought their staff needed were queried against the same list of topics as those offered to individuals. These are compared in the table below. The type of library in which the managers worked undoubtedly has an influence on the responses they gave, so one should not read too much into the results. However, in many instances there was considerable similarity of response, which makes the variations in other cases more interesting. Managers preferred staff to make use of short, contact courses and presentations, the same as the staff themselves, with 'workshops' featuring in the supplied responses. Incentives for staff focused on time and money. Differences in managers' and staff responses appear to depend on the range of managers responding to this question. Managers were also asked to comment on how they evaluate the effectiveness of CPD programs, and 95 of them provided details. 31.5 per cent of organisations required a process of feedback to colleagues, either through a written report or oral presentation (and in some cases, both). Just over half of them focused on the impact of the course on the employee in the workplace, with demonstrated new skills or knowledge, improved performance, or altered behaviour being cited. This was both what was observed by the manager, and what was discussed with or suggested by the staff member as part of a more formal process. Improved attitude was also mentioned, along with new ideas, motivation and enthusiasm, and staff being 'inspired and invigorated': 'The individual response; ie attitude to their work, increased confidence, enthusiasm, and skill levels, desire to put into practice what has been learned'. and 'Very important for intangibles -networking, personal challenge, time away from normal environment and tasks'. Another measure was the staff member' s increase in overall knowledge of the wider picture and their contribution to the organisation as a whole: 'Increased depth of understanding of librarianship and the key issues that currently impact on it. Increased effectiveness in terms of contribution to the team and the library' s services as a whole'. Formal performance appraisal processes were mentioned, although they were explicit in only 10.5 per cent of responses, and less formal 'discussions with staff after the course' may have implied this type of appraisal as well. Comments included, sadly, one response of 'Don't know'.
All respondents were offered the chance to comment generally, and they were generous in providing these overall comments to clarify their responses. These comments provide some food for thought. Contrast the interest in short courses and presentations with 'Generally too fluffy at the moment -slideshows', and 'often general courses are offered but they don't lead on to anything else eg level 1 to level 2, or the courses AugusT 2006
Keeping the roses watered: the continuing professional development of librarians in New Zealand are quite specific and no general or overview is offered'. Respondents sought courses which suited their personal situations, as well as their workplace needs: 'I am also getting older, so doing a full day' s work, going home, and making a meal and then going out to evening meetings is getting quite taxing, particularly when you have a partner and boomerang kids who think it' s Mum' s job to feed them and keep the house going'. Managers identified the need for 'Practice-based and relevant, rather than theoretical and academic' and 'Shorter, focused workshops are best … time away to attend courses puts a strain on those left behind, so intense workshops would be my preference'.
A number of respondents erroneously perceived the survey as focusing on The Open Polytechnic' s courses and tailored their responses to this context. Several noted a public and academic library focus at the expense of special libraries in the selection of topics to be rated as relevant to their needs: 'Would not attend if primarily aimed at public libraries', and, 'As usual you demonstrate the NZ bias towards public and academic type library environments with the selections you have offered in Part 2. This is not reassuring to someone outside these environments who might be forced to undertake CPD that is not relevant to be ""associated"".' (This despite the researchers' covering a range of topics in Part 2 and asking for others to be specified.)
The fact remains, of course, that public and academic librarians make up the bulk of the profession. CPD providers need a large enough pool of interest to make development of courses viable. Special librarians, like records managers, need to be able to take an active role in the development of their own CPD and think outside the square in order to make the most of opportunities. There is clearly, however, a need which is not being met for these professionals: 'Like to see more integration between records management, archives and libraries. Like to see development for special libraries'.
Managers did not perceive a bias to either public or academic libraries -although this is likely to be because there were more managers from these libraries responding, and fewer from the special libraries. Instead their concerns were on the quality, availability and appropriate focus of library and information science CPD. One commented that the survey focused on library work and personal development, and that there was tertiary study (such as legal studies) relevant to their work. 'This is very time consuming, means my employer has to be supportive, and does improve my skills for my job'. Several commented that training for non-professional skills such as communication, time management, and the like, was readily available and that it was in relation to professional skills where there was a gap.
Summary
The need for better quality, focused CPD directed at specific library sectors clearly exists. The public and academic library market is sizeable enough that CPD can be more feasibly developed for this sector and then offered more widely to the profession. Small libraries and special libraries, especially those in the corporate sector, are more difficult to cater for, due to the limited size of the market. Recent entrants into the New Zealand library CPD market such as CAVAL and Know Where Consulting are expanding the range of CPD offerings available but appear to be focussing on courses already developed, or those with wide appeal in order to remain commercially viable as training providers. Whether these satisfy the particular demands of the profession over time remains to be seen, as content, delivery method, availability, and cost are all factors identified as affecting the uptake of CPD across the profession. Other factors in the marketplace including the e-government strategies and the move towards professional registration by LIANZA will have an impact on the type, content and even uptake of CPD in the immediate future, but the nature and extent of this is as yet unknown.
The final comment on CPD comes from one of the respondents to the Needs Assessment. This respondent summarises the dilemma of CPD in terms of its usefulness to the individual, the supporting institution or workplace, and the profession as a whole. It also brings the CPD discussion out of the theoretical and academic, back into the practical and applicable. The question was about what motivates you to participate in CPD, and this reply was broad ranging There' s never a single reason, generally it is a combination of many of the above factors, plus a personal sense of responsibility and commitment to myself and to my employer to actively seek opportunities to keep informed and up to date with issues. I also feel very strongly that as an individual it is necessary to be proactive and to be responsible (though it' s hard at times) to ensure some sort of learning outcome(s) occur from the learning experience and that where practical this is fed back into work and/or the workplace. (Very holier than thou, but this is probably a reaction to working with staff who want to attend everything but also seem to expect to be spoon fed information but don't seem to recognize the need to then process or reflect on it in terms of their day to day work (perhaps this is simplistic and more to do with the structures that are/aren't in place in the workplace?) OR those staff who don't show any interest at all in CPD. Both are difficult and different issues but there may be value in consciously addressing them, somehow in a CPD situation?)",6095,6777

They support the academic programme of the university through their information resources and facilities. In the acquisition of these information resources, every discipline in the university curriculum is given serious consideration. Services offered by the university libraries include provision of an organized collection of printed or other materials or combination thereof, a staff trained to provide and interpret such materials as required to meet the information, cultural, recreational or educational needs of clientele and the physical facilities necessary to support such a collection, staff, and students (Abubakar, 2016). The university library also provides reference services and all possible information needs for researchers, students, academic staff as well as neighbouring communities. University libraries provide technical service such as book binding, printing, editorial and reprographic services. These services are aimed at ensuring fast and quick accessibility to the available print and non-print information resources to staff and students at all times.\nCurrent advances in information and communication technology which has led to the creation of knowledge based economy and market globalization has consequently made the development of human resources in academic libraries a burning issue. Human resource development is a set of systematic and planned activities designed by an organization to\nThe duty of a librarian in a university library includes selecting, developing, cataloguing and classifying library resources. Others include answering researchers' enquiries, management of staff, (including recruitment, training) and/ or playing supervisory role. Other duties performed by librarians include supporting independent research and learning, assisting readers to use computer equipment, conducting literature search, and providing library resources to users. In Nigeria, one is qualified to become a librarian when he has obtained a degree in Library and Information Science in a recognised university (The Librarian Registration Council of Nigeria, 2010). Librarians are expected to possess strong IT skills, team work and managerial skills, verbal communication skills and familiarity with the use of databases and the Internet. However, these skills can only be well displayed if librarians are exposed to efficient training and development programmes.\nTraining is a learning process in which employees acquire skills, experience and attitudes that they need in order to perform their job better for the achievement of their organizational goals. According to Amoah-Mensah (2016), training is the formal and modification of behaviour through learning which occurs as a result of education, instruction and planned experience. Training involves the acquisition and changing skills, knowledge, attitude and social behaviour for the purpose of an occupation or work (Aroge, 2012). Training is the preparation for specific skills which is job or task-oriented, rather than personal. Staff training is a programme that helps employees to learn specific knowledge or skills to improve performance in their current job. A training programme allows an employee to strengthen those skills he needs to improve on his job. Training results are specific. The basic idea behind training is to give the employee the skills required for him to accomplish the requirements of his job. Training is increasingly considered to be a key function in helping university libraries achieve their goals through its staff as it is becoming more generally accepted that there is a correlation between organizational success and investment in training and development.\nStaff development is a long term educational process, utilizing a systematic and organized procedure by which managerial personnel gain conceptual and theoretical knowledge for general purpose. Library staff development can be viewed as activities and programmes that help staff members of the library to learn about responsibilities and develop required skills necessary to accomplish institutional and divisional goals of the library. Dutta (2012) define staff development as processes, programmes and activities through which every organization develops, enhances and improves the skills, competences and overall performances of its employees and workers. Development is a long term plan rather than learning tasks that are needed immediately (Kimberlee, 2018) The importance of training and development programmes in the university libraries cannot be over emphasized. Ifidon and Ifidon (2007) identified the objective of library training and development as: to enable staff to make a more effective contribution to the library's total effort in its service mission; makes the individual look for satisfaction that goes beyond economic gain; self-pride, self-respect and achievement; prepare the staff for challenge of complex modern technology which require an integration of activities and persons of diverse and specialized competence; enables the library staff to develop a life of their own outside the library; make the staff receptive to change and innovation rather than resistant to them; create a climate where the dignity of employees as human beings, not just as factors contributing to the library's efficiency is respected; and to prepare the individual for a new, different and higher responsibility.\nThe university library like any other organization is aimed at achieving goals and objectives set by its parent institution. Attainment of high productivity cannot be achieved if the overall job performance is not enhanced. If a university library wants to achieve the highest degree of job performance, efficient and sufficient staff training and development must be put in place.\nPerformance therefore is the implementation of an action of one's ability in relation to achieving the quality, quantity, cooperation, dependability and creativity in behaviour of an individual (Ekere, 2012). Performance is considered as the measure of quality of human capital which is held as the key thrust in the organization. As Saka (2013) observed, job performance is the ability to carry out statutory functions which are based on the field of specialization or areas of development as well as organization's objective. Saka further stated that job performance in library situation is directed towards meeting not only the user's information needs but also serves as basis or criteria for staff promotion.\nThe advent of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has changed the sophistication and pattern of information needs of librarians. This development has made impactful changes in the collection, storage, retrieval, distribution and access process of information. The university library therefore requires librarians to possess a greater variety of skills with which to utilize these modern information and communication technologies to enhance their services and provide adequate resources for the university community. It is imperative that the university administrators must recognize that library staff must be given the opportunities to develop their skills, knowledge and abilities for them to contribute effectively to the fulfilment of the library's mandate and strategic objectives. Continuous training and development of library staff is a significant factor in encouraging innovation and creativity and ensuring that the library is the information starting point of users (Cobblah, 2015).\nNo matter the size of a functional academic library as well as the scope and strength of the collection, the library management cannot meet its set goals if librarians are not well-trained and developed. In the work parlance, a number of factors interact to affect both the quantity and quality of workers' efforts towards their job performance. How acquainted they are with their jobs may affect their performance in their jobs, their relationships with their co-workers, subordinates, clients, physical health, social lives and adjustment. In the long-run these will affect the mental health, happiness and longevity of librarians. Well trained staff are happier and more productive. They tend to perform duties assigned to them with total commitment, concentration and dedication, the end of which is a good result. Employees who are well trained to perform their duties usually are conscientious workers who show pride in the quality and quantity of their work. However, enthusiasm, commitment, pride and productivity are the cornerstone of employee engagement.\nStaff training and development programmes in the library include simple orientation programmes, organized visits, seminars and conferences, participatory management, job rotation, internal training programmes, formal professional library education, short courses and so on. Lack of training and development of librarians in university libraries may affect the quality of service, professional career development and this will affect productivity and job performance of librarians. This implies that when librarians are exposed to training and development they will contribute their quota in the teaching, learning and research activities of the university.\nStatement of Problem\nToday, library services in universities the world over is becoming IT driven. Traditional library services based mainly on print media is no longer in vogue. Both teaching and learning have assumed a new dimension in most academic communities. Changes in the learning and research environment that complement the new technology is also changing the services library provides. These new services include online references, desktop document delivery, automated self-service system, Online Public Access Catalogue and others. Expectedly, university libraries in response to these changes need to institute regular staff training and development to enhance librarian's job performance.\nClearly, an employee's productivity has a direct bearing with the level of learning or skill which he has acquired before or during employment. Given that one cannot give what he does not have, a librarian's contribution towards the growth and success of library service in the university is dependent on the quality of training and development which he has acquired.\nFrom the researchers experience in federal university library in Nigeria, it was observed that some library users no longer show interest in using the library. Out of curiosity, the researchers approached some of them to find out the reason. They complained that they no longer receive the attention they desired from library staff especially the librarians. This necessitated the need to embark on this study to investigate whether lack of staff training and development contributed to librarian's job performance in federal university libraries in South-South Nigeria. This study was therefore carried out to determine the influence of staff training and development on librarian's job performance in federal university libraries in South-South Nigeria. \nHypothesis\nThe following hypothesis were formulated and tested at 0.05 level of significance; 1. There is no significant difference in the job performance mean scores of librarians based on extent of staff training programmes in federal university libraries in South-South Nigeria. 2. There is no significant difference in the job performance mean scores of librarians based on extent of staff development programmes in federal university libraries in South-South Nigeria.\nReview of Related Literature\nA university library is an academic library attached to an institution of higher learning. Akobundu ( 2013) sees an academic library as a library attached to a higher education institution, which serves basically two complementary purposes; to support the school's curriculum, and to support the research activities of the members of the university community. International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA, 2010) describe an academic library as a library associated with a college or university which supports the mission of the institution and the research needs of its faculty, staff and students.\nFurthermore, academic libraries work together with other organs of their institution to achieve the mission of their institution through careful selection and provision of relevant information resources as well as in the teaching of information literacy, competencies. Ka ( 2015) is of the view that academic libraries do not just store books and journals and offer space for student learning, they also provide digitized information through their electronic information resources. Singh (2017) stated that institutions of learning all over the world are laying more emphasis on research. With the help of professional librarians in these libraries who organize their collection accordingly to suit the research needs of the academic community.\nStaff Training\nStaff training is the teaching or learning activities carried out for the primary purpose of helping members of an organization to acquire and apply the knowledge, skills, abilities and attitudes needed by that organization. Training is the process of equipping the workforce with the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitude to tackle the job responsibilities (Uzohuo, 2017).\nFactors such as the impact of new technology, -information explosion; new policies and methods for the organization and provision of information, have made it absolutely essential for librarians to engage actively in staff training if they are to remain professionally up-todate and, more importantly, if they are to provide services that meet the challenge imposed on them by these new developments. Frost (2018) stated that training programmes is aimed to strengthen those skills which each employee needs to improve, and brings all employees to have similar skills and knowledge to enable them perform their duties. This is important because the frequency of a patron to the library largely depends on the way staff are able to help them to locate information. In addition, staff training refers to programmes that provide staff with information, new skills, or professional development opportunities. This simply means that training is bridging the gap between the current performance and the standard desired performance. Training programmes not only develop staff but also help organizations or institutions to make the best use of their human resources in favour of gaining competitive advantage and achieving optimum performance. Staff training and development activities in the libraries do not only help staff to meet the challenges of providing information to support the academic programmes of the library, but it also helps to sustain the growth of the library which eventually helps to improve upon the individual staff effectiveness (Pan &Hovde, 2010). Staff training programmes available to librarians include orientation, in service workshop, computer training and others. Training in relation to this study is a learning process which empowers the librarian with new skills, knowledge and expertise for the actualisation of the goals of the university library. Types of training for librarians according to Adeniji (2010) include:\nIn-service training: An in -service programme is a professional training or staff development effort where professionals are trained. Librarians are introduced to an automated library system and to the varieties of software that can be used for the development and management of an automated library. The training will help staff to update their knowledge of professional competence. Akinpelu (2002) define in-service training as an in-house programme for staff in many government and business enterprises. It is widely used for continuing education for teachers as well as librarians, bankers and industrial workers. Induction/orientation: This is carried out for new entrants on the job to make them familiar with the total corporation so as to understand the job.\nOn-the-job training:\nVestibule: This is done through industrial attachment for the purpose of skills and technology transfer. It is therefore achieved through placement of an individual within another area of relevant work or organization. The effect is the acquisition of practical and specialized skills.\nFormal Training: A practical and theoretical teaching process, which could be done within or outside an organization. When training is carried out inside an organization, it is called an in-house training. Off-house training is carried out in professionalized training areas like: Universities, Polytechnics and Professional Institutes. Library staff may be given the opportunity to obtain higher degrees in various higher institutions.\nStaff Development\nWhereas staff development is a process of providing employees with new knowledge, skills and abilities in line with the goals and values of the organisation and in relation to the interests and needs of the employees. Staff development is intended to strengthen the capability of an organisation to perform its mission more effectively and efficiently by encouraging and providing for growth of human resources. According to Jacobs and Washington (2010), staff development refers to an integrated set of planned programmes provided over a period of time to help assure that all individuals have the competence necessary to perform to their fullest potential in support of the organisational goals. As a process, employee development encompasses the learning acquired by all individuals in organisations including frontline employees, professionals or managers and can be delivered through a range of approaches including, off-the-job and on-the job training programmes. The overall intent of employee development programmes is to provide a systematic path for increasing the employee's competence, regardless of whether the increase in competence would be used for doing present or future work (Jacobs & Washington 2010).\nEmployee development promotes the growth and advancement of individual employees within the organisation in order to enable the organisations to grow (Lee &Hur, 2012). Patrick and Kumar (2012), note that employee development is a continuous effort to upgrade the employee's and the organisation's skills, abilities and knowledge. Staff development programmes in the library include professional conferences, professional workshops, field trips and others.\nThe terms training and development are often used interchangeably, even though they have some similarities and differences. It is therefore, necessary to delineate these differences in order to clarify the activities associated with each term and desired outcomes within an organisation. Employee training in particular is associated with on-the-job skills acquired for a particular role, while development on the other hand covers a wide range of activities directed towards the personal and professional growth including coaching and formal education (Mwinyihasan, 2011). Mukhopadhyaya cited in Anyaegbu (2011) outlined the basic difference between training and development as follows; training is a short term process and refers to instruction in technical and mechanical process. It is targeted in most cases for non-managerial personnel and is meant for specific job related purpose.\nDevelopment is a long term educational process which is philosophical and imbibes theoretical educational concepts. It is targeted at the managerial personnel cadre. According to Mukhopadhyaya ( 2009), the purpose of training is to improve productivity, quality, organizational climate, as well as to increase health, safety and enhance personal growth in the organization. Manpower development on the other hand is aimed at improving managerial performance by imparting knowledge, changing attitudes and increasing skills.\nThe major objective of manpower development is managerial effectiveness through a planned deliberate process of learning. In relation to this study, staff development could be defined as a range of systematically planned activities designed by the library management to provide long term learning opportunities to professionals to equip them with knowledge, skills and attitudes geared towards their career development.\nStaff Development Needs in University Libraries\nThere are various staff development needs across various universities in the world, which Nigeria is included. Mohammad (2013) identifies development programmes that are needed in university libraries to include:\nProfessional training; Professional staff of the library are enrolled in different workshops held at the academy to sharpen their skills and improve their knowledge of work environment and technical skills. This initiative helps to build their horizon about specific library activities and inculcate positive attitude towards learning and search strategy. These professional training may include special lectures on professional ethics, professionalism in the work environment and customer satisfaction.\nWorkshops and conferences: Librarians are sponsored to attend national and international conferences and workshops to widen their professional ethics and values.\nProblem solving groups: Individuals perform professional activities during their entire professional career but are normally unaware of novel situations. In this kind of training, Avocation: Undertaking an extra activity in addition to current duties provide ample opportunity for staff to develop their skills. For example, library staff involved in management, facilitation/coordination are presented with case studies, supervision and guidance of internees.\nField Trips: Field trips are useful tools that provide experiential learning outside the work environment. The doctrine behind this situated learning experience is to analyse the event in terms of concepts surrounding the knowledge so as to develop a deeper understanding. As part of the training workshop staff take part in a variety of trips to enhance and contextualize their learning. \nJob Performance\nThe essence of staff training and development is to enhance job performance. Performance can generally be defined from three levels: organization, team and individual. It can simply be regarded as the record of outcome achieved. Organizational performance depends on how the leaders perceive the organizational goals. Kristen (2015) define job performance as work related activities expected of an employee and how well those activities are executed. The decisions as to what an organisation wants its employees to do lie with the leaders in the organisation. In the library, job performance involves all aspects, which directly or indirectly affect and relate to the work of the librarians geared towards satisfying the needs of the library users. Performance means both behaviour and results. Behaviour emanates from the performer and transforms performance from abstraction to action. Uzohuo (2017) define librarian job performance as the ability of the librarians to communicate with library users and help them understand how to source for information based on their skills, adaptability, creativity, and innovatively. Librarians need training in group dynamics, interpersonal relations, and in systems to understand better how all parts of their library fit together and affect each other. Training play a key role in ensuring that librarians are armed with competent skills that will enhance the provision of effective library services to meet the client's changing information needs (Steed, 2010). Training and development is an effective tool to equip or propel employees to improve their performance. Librarians' job performance can come through basic knowledge of computers and their capabilities. It can also come with competency with search engines, Internet facilities e-mail, Internet navigator tools, web browsers and web file formats; database software; Internet development and management know-how, and human management (Pfeffer, 2014). Librarians that are trained are able to become proactive, creative, and innovative. This is because diligence, zealousness and proactive behaviourspur the librarian to persevere in challenges that will result from the deployment of new technology and enable him to resist any detractor or inhibiting reactions of other stakeholders. In this study, job performance of a librarian is conceptualised as the degree to which a librarian understands work related activities of the library in terms of information provision, retrieval, dissemination and use, and how well that information related activities are executed to achieve the goals and objectives of the library.\nEffect of Staff Training and Development on Librarian's Performance\nStaff training and development programmes in the university library do not only help staff to meet the challenges of providing information to support the academic programmes of the university, it also helps to sustain the growth of the library, which eventually helps to improve upon the individual staff effectiveness. The studies of Asiagodo ( 2009) summarizes how staff training and development affects librarians' performance which includes to provide the librarians with training and development opportunities that will enable them to update their professional knowledge, skills, and abilities for higher productivity, foster a climate that facilitates personal self-fulfilment, institutional effectiveness, creativity and system renewal. Others include, to enhance the standard of performance of librarians in the current and future jobs. It also helps maintain and increase job satisfaction, provide support for career advancement within the organization and maintain good staff morale and increased productivity.\nProfessional development of a librarian begins the moment he/she is inducted into the profession after graduating from the university. Formal classroom instruction in the Department of Library and Information Science covers generalized knowledge about fundamental concepts and theories of library systems and operations. Professional librarians are evaluated and promoted based on scholarship and professionalism and this requires that librarians continue to be engaged in staff training and development activities (Pan &Hovde, 2010). There is therefore, the need for professionalism in providing these library services. Professionalism in a general sense is a term that entails the art of playing expertise in one's\nInfluence of Staff Training and Development on Librarians Job Performance in Federal\nUniversity Libraries in South-South Nigeria field; trying to meet up with the standard as demanded by the profession. Professionalism in library and information services is regarded as a 'hidden treasure'. Librarianship is anchored on six tenets of a profession which include: professional association, assessment process for entry, code of ethics, exercise of autonomous thought and judgment, use of experts and continuing education (Yaya &Adeeko, 2015).\nThe Nigeria Library Association serves as the umbrella organization for persons interested in libraries, librarianship and Information Services in Nigeria. It seeks among other things to promote the establishment and development of libraries and to assist in the promotion of such legislation as may be considered necessary for the establishment, regulation and management of libraries in Nigeria. Since inception, its activities have been centred on capacity building of librarians and the development of all types of libraries for steady relevance in the society.\nAccording to Olorunsaye and Ayanyeemi (2013)  The data generated from this study was analysed using simple percentage and descriptive statistics of mean score. Simple percentage was used to analyse Research Questions one and two respectively. Whereas in Research Questions, three and four, descriptive statistics of weighted mean scores were used for the analysis. Training and development were calibrated into extremely trained (10 and above), highly trained (7-9), moderately trained (4-6), not well trained (0-3). The cut off point for items is 2.50 which was obtained by adding all the weighted values and dividing the total by four. (4+3+2+1= 10/4). Thereafter, the mean score of 2.50 and above was regarded as agreed while those below 2.50 was regarded as disagree. This means that such programmes did not influence librarians' job performance. The Hypotheses were tested with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) at 0.05 level of significance. Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS, version 23) was used for data analysis. Where the p-value is less than the alpha level (p Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.05), the null hypotheses were rejected otherwise, but where it is equal to or greater than the alpha level, the null hypotheses were accepted.\nPresentation and Analysis of Data\nData collected were analysed and presented in tables below according to the research questions that guided the study.\nResearch Question 1: What staff training programmes exist in federal university libraries in South-South Nigeria. The results as shown in Table 1 indicate that all the staff training programmes listed received more than 70% positive response rating in all the university libraries studied. Visit to other libraries received the highest rating of 90.2%. This was closely followed by in-service workshop programme and job rotation each of which received 89.1%. The least rating (though still on the positive) was received by mentorship /coaching which had 78%. The Result of the analysis in Table 4 shows the job performance mean score of librarians in federal university libraries based on the staff development programmes received. The response rate is on the influence the staff development programmes have had on their job performance. Out of the 11 staff development programmes listed, only 7 received positive mean score rating. The highest rating was received by meeting information needs of users with mean score rating of 3.53. This was closely followed by evaluation of information which received a mean score rating of 3.45. Out of the 11 items listed in Table 4, there are four items that received negative mean score ranging from 2.36-1.75. These are understanding the information needs of users, understanding information sources, organization of information and information search/ retrieval of information. Organization of information received the least mean score rating of 1.75.\nTest of Hypotheses\n\nHypothesis One\nThere is no significance difference in the job performance mean scores of librarians based on the extent of the staff training received in federal university libraries in South-South Nigeria. \nHypothesis Two\nThere is no significance difference in the job performance mean scores of librarians based on the extent of development programmes received in federal university libraries in South-South Nigeria. These job performance variables include understanding the information needs of users and understanding the information sources, acquisition and organisation of information, evaluation, retrieval and timely delivery of information were high. Staff development has a great influence on job performance of librarians in federal university libraries in South-South Nigeria. 5. There is no significance difference in the job performance mean scores of librarians based on the extent of staff training received. 6. There is no significance difference in the job performance mean scores of librarians based on the extent of staff development programmes received.\nDiscussion of Result\nStaff training that exist in federal university libraries in South-South Nigeria. \nLibrarians job performance based on the staff training available\nThe result on the influence of librarians' job performance based on staff training they received shows that librarians were of the view that staff training helped to improve their job performance. The librarians agreed that training programmes have helped them in understanding the information needs of users and understanding the information sources, acquisition and organisation of information, evaluation, retrieval and timely delivery of information. The resultant effect is that the librarians have been trained to provide library services required by library users of the federal university libraries in South South Nigeria. Furthermore, the study found out that there is significance difference in the job performance mean scores of librarians based on the extent of their staff training. This implies that staff training given to librarians has to a great extent, affected their job performance. Expectedly, each staff training given to the librarians has effect on the job performance of librarians and hence difference in the mean scores. This finding also agrees with Nkebem (2006) finding that orientation, in-service training, on-the-job training and provision for in-service training boosts the morale of librarians towards their job. The study also corroborates the study of Abubakar ( 2016) in a study on motivational factors as correlate of job performance of librarians in state-owned universities in North-Central Nigeria. The result of the study showed that there is significant relationship between staff training and job performance of librarians in state owned universities in North-Central Nigeria.\nLibrarian's job performance based on the staff development programmes received.\nThe study found that there is significance difference in the job performance mean scores of librarians based on the extent of development programmes received. This shows that development programmes given to librarians have some influenced on librarians' job performance in the understanding the information needs of the users, understanding information sources, understanding information sources based on needs, acquisition of information, organization of information resources and so on. Staff development programmes received also positive influence in enhanced information literacy, timely delivery of information and enhanced user satisfaction.\nThis finding is in line with Saka and Haruna (2013) findings that Seminars/conferences and workshop attendance enhances job performance of staff. As the staff development programmes collectively increased, the job performance of staff tends to be higher. The increase in opportunities for the various staff development programmes led to higher job performance on the part of librarians in federal university libraries in South-South Nigeria. This finding also agrees with Ashante (2014) findings that development programmes have positive statistical relationship with job performance. \nConclusion\n\nImplication of Findings\nFrom the findings, staff training and development enhance librarians' job performance and consequently the quality of service they render to both staff and students of the university. Non availability of programmes or non-participation in these programmes may lead to lethargy and obsolesce. This will have negative effect both on the librarians and library services in federal university libraries in South-South Nigeria.\nRecommendations\nBased on the findings of this study, the following were recommended: 1. University library management in South-South Nigeria should make conscious effort to ensure that all staff training packages that exist in university libraries are provided for their staff to enhance better job performance. libraries should strategize on how to raise funds both internally and externally to sponsor their staff to attend and benefit from these programmes.",6221,6916

The practice of reference work has been changing rapidly due to new information resources, emerging services, alternative ways of organizing work, and increased expectations of users. We review the literature in order to identify the competencies for refer ence work that have been pinpointed as necessary for today's work environment, and we present results of a study in which we explored the extent to which professional development of reference librarians was occurring in large public libraries in Ontario.
We examine those competencies reference librarians were choosing to acquire through formal and informal professional devel opment activities, and we explore barriers that might be preventing reference librarians from participating in these activities.

Reference librarians have been facing a decade of rapid change in the workplace: new information resources, emerging services, alternative ways of organiz ing work, and increased expectations of users. All these point to an urgent need to keep up-to-date the knowl edge and skills for public service and reference work. In this article, we review the literature in order to identify the competencies for reference work that have been pin pointed as necessary for today's work environment. We present results of a study in which we explored the extent to which professional development of reference librari ans was occurring in large public libraries in Ontario. We examine those competencies reference librarians are choosing to acquire through formal and informal profes sional development activities, and we explore barriers that might be preventing reference librarians from par ticipating in these activities. Our discussion focuses on the meaning of the results for the professional develop ment of librarians in the twenty-first century.
Technological change, in the form of the develop ment of the Internet and electronic resources, is chang ing the practice of reference work. The development of electronic resources has changed the volume, nature, and quality of the information sources available. Where reference librarians once relied solely on print resources, they can now answer the majority of ques tions accurately using only Web-based sources.1
However, there is evidence that traditional print resources still form the main source of answers to refer ence questions in public libraries.2 Thus, there are con cerns about the ability of the reference librarians to use Internet sources to answer reference questions.
Change is also occurring due to management prac tices. Organizational restructuring, increased use of paraprofessionals on the reference desk, and growth in part-time employment have resulted in changing roles for librarians. The knowledge and skills that librarians have acquired through formal education and on-the job experience may no longer be relevant for jobs that have been redesigned.
The graying of the profession is also leading to con cerns about whether librarians are keeping their
Reference & User Services Quarterly, vol. 44 Libraries are adopting a competency approach to man age their human resources. Competencies are the knowl edge, skills, and personal traits that enable the professional librarian to function effectively in the tasks considered essential in the profession. 4 Identifying competencies emphasizes the requisite qualifications in terms of a combi nation of knowledge, skills, and experience for successful performance of the job rather than the means by which the qualifications were obtained. Human resource managers use competencies in a variety of ways: as a hiring tool, to determine training and development needs, as performance standards, and even as a basis for compensation schemes.
Lists of competencies abound in the professional litera ture, but the profession has yet to come to a consensus about a single set of competencies. Competencies have been identified in terms of library function (acquisitions); client group served (young adults); subject specialization (law); place of work (special library); and specific skills (technology skills).5
Competencies for Reference Work
Only very recently has a list of professional competencies for reference and user services librarians been developed by the Reference and User Services Association of the American Library Association.6 Competencies are defined as behaviors that distinguish excellent performers from average perform ers. They are grouped into broad categories of behaviors related to: access; knowledge base; marketing, awareness, informing; collaboration; and evaluation and assessment of resources and services. The list of competencies incorporates behavioral guidelines that focus on behaviors that are corre lated with positive perceptions of reference performance. These behaviors include approachability, interest, listening, effective searching, and follow-up.7
Most writers agree that basic reference skills (how to conduct a reference interview and knowledge of reference sources and local collections) and subject knowledge are a must for reference work as well as communication and interpersonal skills and analytic and creative thinking skills.8 Technological skills, management skills, and instructional skills are increasing in importance as well.9
In library schools, students are introduced to basic ref erence skills, but it has been suggested that it takes at least eight hours a week on the reference desk over a two-year period to become a minimally competent reference librar ian.10 The ability to conduct an appropriate reference inter view and knowledge of sources in all formats were among the most highly rated competencies for work in public, aca demic, and special libraries.11 As Nofsinger points out, ref erence librarians have become ""information counselors, mediators between users and materials"" in a complex infor mation environment.12 Communication and interpersonal skills have always been necessary for successful reference work but are seen to be even more critical in today's automated environment.
Even spelling skills are a prerequisite for successful informa tion retrieval.13 Public service librarians regularly prepare brochures, pathfinders, flyers, instructional guides, and articles for local newsletters.14 Dealing with users in-person requires a complex set of communication skills while deal ing with users by telephone, through e-mail, or via Internet Relay Chat (IRC) requires an additional set of skills.15 Analytic and creative thinking skills are becoming more important as the information environment becomes more complex. Skills in problem solving and critical thinking are necessary for information professionals, particularly for reference work. 16 Sherrer points out that traditional refer ence sources have been issued in new formats or replaced altogether by new sources, and it is not feasible to expect one person to have a thorough knowledge of the vast array of electronic sources available.17 Successful reference librar ians must be able to experiment, try new processes and search strategies, show initiative, and be collaborative.
Reference work not only involves retrieval of relevant infor mation, it also requires the evaluation of the information or documents retrieved. The critical evaluation of informa tion retrieved from the Internet is an important role of the reference librarian.18 Librarians are also required to gather and analyze pertinent data to produce reports on their ref erence activities and describe the information behaviors and satisfaction of their users. 19 Technological skills are a necessary competency for ref erence librarians. The information environment in libraries can include an integrated library system to man age the OPAC, circulation, acquisitions, and cataloging functions of the library; electronic information services; CD-ROMs; public access computers providing access to the Internet and to office software suites; local area networks; imaging systems; and devices for visually handicapped users. Reference librarians need to be able to use these sys tems well enough so that they can show users how to oper ate the systems. 20 Stafford and Serban suggest three levels of technological expertise for librarians: librarians who possess basic computer skills and versatility with a number of electronic systems; librarians who are expert in a single system; and, systems librarians who are responsible for all information system developments in the library.21 Reference librarians must also develop their manage ment skills. In addition to hiring, training, and evaluating professional, technical, clerical, and student staff, librari ans have become involved in decisions regarding a broad array of new technologies, planning and delivering services to diverse user groups, and mounting significant public relations and fund-raising campaigns.22 Massey-Burzio suggests that knowledge of organizational behavior, man aging conflict and organizational change, motivation, and marketing techniques is valuable. 23 Instructional skills are becoming more important. Traditionally, instruction fell on the shoulders of biblio graphic instruction librarians. Today, all librarians must be prepared to instruct users on a range of topics, from how to use a computer to how to find information on the Internet.
One-on-one instruction and group instruction techniques must be mastered. It can be argued that all contact with users involves some degree of teaching. 24 Finally, the personal traits that are necessary for refer ence work are many. A service commitment is perhaps the most widely listed. The focus on the user and his or her immediate information need is at the center of reference work. Other desirable personal traits include liking people, sensitivity to others' needs, collegiality, confidence, diplo macy, emotional stability, imagination, resourcefulness, patience, tolerance, curiosity, to name a few. 25 
Professional Development Activities of Librarians
Professional development activities can be characterized as formal or informal types of activities. Formal activities include courses and workshops offered in-house, by educa tional institutions, or by professional associations.
Informal activities include attending conferences, discus sions with colleagues, participating in e-mail discussion lists, reading the professional literature, and pursuing self directed projects. Formal professional development activities are organ ized, structured programs that explicitly aim to foster understanding, knowledge, and skills. Workshops offered by educational institutions are an example of formal activ ities. Informal activities also involve the pursuit of under standing, knowledge, and skills, but outside the curricula of educational or academic institutions and professional associations.26 Informal learning occurs opportunistically and without strict timetables.27 Conference attendance is considered an informal activity because of the myriad opportunities to network and interact socially and profes sionally with a wide range of peers and colleagues.
Librarians seem to prefer informal types of professional development. Stone carried out a comprehensive survey of professional development activities in the mid-1960s.28
The activities that rated as most important for professional development for her 138 respondents were: reading profes sional literature in library science and subject specialty; attending library conventions and meetings; participating in library associations; recruiting for the profession; and visiting other libraries. Special librarians ranked reading in their subject specialty first, while public, academic, and school librarians ranked it slightly lower. Special librarians also rated writing for the profession much higher than did other groups. Public librarians ranked in-service training second in importance, while other groups rated it much lower. In addition, public librarians ranked speaking to community groups higher than did other groups.
Parson studied the types of continuing education activ ities undertaken by 375 academic librarians in the mid 1980s. 29 In the previous two years, the activities in which the librarians most actively participated were reading; attending professional meetings, conferences and conven tions; in-house staff meetings; and ""bull sessions"" with col leagues. The highest rated format for effectiveness was research, followed by credit courses toward a degree, intern ships, reading, and writing for publication. The highest rated preferred format for continuing education was read ing, followed by one-day institutes or workshops, two-day or longer institutes or workshops, research, and short intensive courses.
A study of continuing education undertaken by special librarians in the early 1990s found that the most used form of continuing education was workshops sponsored by com mercial groups such as vendors, followed by workshops sponsored by professional associations, in-house training offered by the organization, and workshops offered by aca demic institutions.30
Self-directed learning projects are also a well-used form of professional development. Varlejs found that 77 percent of the 521 librarians she studied had conducted one or more self-directed work-related learning projects requiring at least seven hours in the previous six months. 31 Overall, librarians spent three times as many hours on self-directed learning as on formal continuing education.
Training for entry-level reference librarians has been the focus of a few studies. Bauner asked the heads of reference in 103 libraries, both academic and public, to list the three most important items of information or abilities they need to teach entry-level reference librarians.32 At the head of the list was ""Reference interview techniques,"" followed by ""Use of technology."" In academic libraries, ""Use of technology"" was at the head of the list followed by ""Reference interview techniques."" Also included in the list of need-to-know top ics were reference sources, policies and procedures of the library, and teaching skills. In public libraries, entry-level reference librarians needed to learn reference interview techniques, reference sources, service orientation, how to cope with problem patrons, and how to use technology.
In 60 percent of libraries studied, on-the-job training of newly hired reference librarians primarily involved tours of the library and reference department or observation Volume 44 
Method
Our study was carried out in spring and fall 2001. We sur veyed 733 professional librarians with reference duties who were working in large, urban public libraries in Ontario.
These were library systems that employed at least ten profes sional librarians and that served cities with populations of ninety thousand or larger. We identified twenty library sys tems; of these, one system declined to participate, while another system did not use professional librarians on the reference desk, leaving eighteen library systems in the study.
The reference librarians were sent a twelve-page ques tionnaire that contained items designed to measure the participation of the librarians in various types of profes sional development activities and their topics of study. A total of 553 questionnaires were returned, for a response rate of 75.4 percent.
Professional development activities included on the questionnaire were both formal and informal types of activities. Examples of formal activities are in-house train ing courses, continuing education courses at an educa tional institution, professional association workshops, and Web-based courses. Informal activities included on the questionnaire were discussions with colleagues, read ing the professional literature, writing/editing for publi cation, on-the-job training, attending conferences, and self-directed projects. Respondents were asked to estimate the number of hours they had spent in the previous year engaging in the different types of formal activities. For informal activities, they were asked to estimate the num ber of hours in the previous month they had spent partic ipating in each type of activity. This estimate was multiplied by twelve to yield an estimate of hours spent in the previous year in each type of activity. The measure of participation in formal activities represents the sum of hours spent in all types of formal activities. The measure of participation in informal activities is similarly con structed. To identify topics of professional development activities, respondents were given a closed list of twelve topics with the option of specifying additional topics under an ""other"" category. higher the score, the greater the perception on the part of the respondent that there were barriers to participation). A factor analysis of the barriers to participation measure revealed two factors: institutional and informational bar riers (lack of quality, lack of convenience, and lack of information); and situational and dispositional barriers (family circumstances, lack of time, and health circum stances).
In this study, situational constraints were indirectly measured through the updating climate construct. 
Results
Of the eighteen library systems that participated in the sur vey, five systems had forty or more reference librarians. The remaining systems had twenty or fewer reference librarians.
The librarians in the study were predominantly female (82. 
Topics of Professional

Development Activities
What were the librarians learning about in their profes sional development activities? The respondents were pre sented with a list of twelve topics and asked if they had been learning about them in their professional develop ment activities. They were also given room to write about any topics that were not covered in the list.
By far the most popular topics were related to Internet applications and electronic resources (table 3). More than 80 percent of respondents had spent time updating their skills in these areas. All public libraries in Ontario have Internet connections for public use and librarians are expected to be able to assist patrons in their use. Electronic resources are also widely available at the libraries in the study. These resources change frequently and keeping up-to-date becomes a challenge. Search strategies for both Internet and electronic resources were also a popular topic as 68 percent of librarians identified this as a topic of study. Office applica tions, particularly word processing and spreadsheet pro grams, are still popular topics of study (65 percent of respondents). These applications are upgraded frequently and require updated knowledge in order to assist users.
Just over half the librarians were learning about the inte grated library system applications in their libraries. A num ber of library systems had amalgamated in the previous year and perhaps librarians were still becoming familiar with new systems. An equal number were brushing up their pub lic service skills. A sample of in-house courses on this topic include how to handle difficult patrons, crisis intervention, and teen awareness.   Reference librarians have had to expand their traditional bibliographic instruction repertoire to cover more topics than just how to use the library catalog. Helping users find information on the Internet, use office applications, and search CD-ROMs are routine tasks today. Supervisory skills are also less frequently studied in professional develop ment activities. One-third of respondents indicated that they had been learning about workplace topics such as occupational health and safety or employee rights and benefits.
Only eighty respondents (14 percent) recorded addi tional topics of study. These topics were related to tradi tional concerns of reference librarians: readers' advisory, children's services, programming ideas, and subject spe cific reference topics.
Deterrents to Participation in Professional Development Activities
To assess the factors that might be preventing the respon dents from participating in professional development activities, multiple regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between participation in professional development activities and the control and independent variables in the study. Each participation measure (partici pation in formal activities and informal activities) was  Due to the skewed distribution of the data, the partici pation variables were transformed by taking the natural logarithm of the values. The transformed variables were used in all the regression analyses. The independent vari ables of interest were all normally distributed. The Barriers to Participation measure had a mean of 51.1 and standard deviation of 12.4. The Updating Climate scale had a mean of 71.3 and standard deviation of 12.3. Table 4 presents the results of the multiple regressions of each participation variable on the control and inde pendent variables. The table shows the standardized regres sion coefficients for barriers to participation, updating climate, R2 for the model, the F-value for the model R2 and the sample size. The details of the results for the other inde pendent and the control variables are not shown. For both equations, the model R2 is significant. For participation in formal activities, F=5.16 (df=9,453, p<.001); and for partici pation in informal activities, F=10.00 (df=9,479, p<.001).
Barriers to Participation is a significant predictor of par ticipation in formal professional development activities {p =-.11, p<.05). The effect of Barriers to Participation is negative. The equation predicts that a unit increase in the Barriers measure will result in a decrease of .07 hours in par ticipation in formal activities.
Updating Climate is a significant predictor of participa tion in informal professional development activities Off =-.11, p<.05). However, the effect of updating climate on participation is negative, in the opposite direction to that expected. The equation predicts that a unit increase in the updating climate measure will result in a decrease of 1.34 hours of participation in informal activities.
Discussion
The results of this study show that reference librarians working in large, urban, public libraries in Ontario are par ticipating in formal and informal activities to update their knowledge skills and abilities. spent by reference librarians in our study in informal learn ing seems to be comparable to the time spent by other pro fessionals and by the general population of Canadians. However, the librarians in our study seem to be spending fewer hours in formal learning activities than other well educated workers.
Based on an average workday of eight hours, librarians in the study spent just over three days in the previous year attending formal professional development activities. This may be due to a lack of interest on the part of the librarians, or it may be due to a lack of library-related formal profes sional development opportunities. Formal activities are provided by the employer, educational institutions, and professional associations. Many of the library systems in the study were not large enough to be able to provide many formal in-house courses, yet these types of opportunities were the most heavily used of the formal types of profes sional development activities. On average, librarians spent about two days attending in-house professional develop ment activities. There seems to be a reliance on the employer to provide formal development opportunities.
Workshops are usually provided by professional associ ations once a year in conjunction with the annual confer ence and last, at most, one day. The librarians in the study averaged a half-day at professional association workshops.
Many of the libraries in the study were located at a con siderable distance from an educational institution provid ing continuing professional education courses. Enrollment in Web-based courses, however, was not perceived as a viable alternative. One librarian mentioned that she had been taking an Internet course, but that the e-mail system in her library was not working. As a result, she was unable to get feedback from the instructor. In addition, due to her workload, it was difficult for her to find the time at work to do the course. Ultimately, she dropped out.
Once new knowledge or skills are learned in a formal setting, there must be a transfer of the new knowledge or skills to the workplace. This implies that there is time to Comments from respondents with respect to confer ence attendance note that opportunities to attend had become fewer for librarians. There was a perception that managers were more likely to be able to attend a confer ence. In many cases, the library did not cover the costs of attending a conference, although time off to attend was allowed. This has had repercussions for professional associ ations. Just over half the librarians in the study were mem bers of a professional association.
The organizational rewards for participating in profes sional development were not clear to the participants in the study. Recognition for keeping up-to-date was neither expected nor received by librarians. On the other hand, there were no clear consequences of not keeping up-to date. The strongest impetus for keeping up-to-date was intrinsic. It was the personal satisfaction that came from providing better service to patrons that motivated the librarians in the sample.
We posed the question as to whether librarians were pursuing professional development using the identified competencies for reference work as a guide. We can con clude that most of the competencies for reference work were related to the topics the librarians were learning about in their professional development activities.
Technological skills seem to have been the area of con centration for the librarians. Internet applications, office applications, electronic resources, and integrated library system applications were very popular topics of study. Communication skills and public service skills were each studied by more than half the respondents. Instructional skills and management skills were studied by about 40 per cent of the respondents. Basic reference skills were not a topic for professional development. In addition, librarians were not developing analytical or creative thinking skills. Analytical skills involve the ability to recognize patterns, draw logical conclusions, and make recommendations for action. Most Masters of Library and Information Science programs have courses in research methods and statistics that develop analytical skills. Respondents did not indicate they were advancing their knowledge of these topics. Nor did the reference librarians in the study indicate that they were advancing their critical thinking skills.
Our study focused on individual and organizational factors that affected participation of reference librarians in professional development activities. Only two of the fac tors included in the larger study were reported here.
Barriers to Participation represent nonwork constraints on participation. Barriers to Participation had a negative effect on participation in formal professional development activ ities. In particular, institutional and informational barriers were the significant barriers to participation. Such things as lack of quality of the professional development activity, inconvenient scheduling or location of the activity, and lack of information about the activity were nonwork deter rents to participation.
The construct of Updating Climate included indicators of situational constraints, that is, work circumstances that interfere with participation, as well as indicators of organi zational support for participation in professional develop ment activities. Updating Climate was found to have a negative effect on participation in informal professional development activities. Further investigation found that the dimension of information sharing was significant in predicting participation levels. This suggests that increas ing the extent to which information is shared within an organization decreases participation in informal activities. This is not so surprising as discussions with colleagues is the second largest component of informal updating. If information is shared willingly, librarians do not see the need to consciously make efforts to learn from others. One of the problems of measuring informal learning is that individuals need to recognize that they are actually learn ing informally before they can report it.44 Thus in organiza tions where information is freely shared, there may not even be a recognition that learning is occurring. The innovative climate dimension was also a predictor of participation in informal professional development activi ties. This factor reflects the fact that the library has a progres sive atmosphere, is viewed as an innovator, provides current equipment, and is concerned with the professional develop ment of its staff. This suggests that where the library is per ceived as not being up-to-date, librarians consciously engage in explicit informal learning to keep their skills up-to-date.
Although librarians commented that their workload was such that they had difficulty participating in both for mal and informal professional development activities, measures of both nonwork time constraints (situational and dispositional factors of the Barriers to Participation measure) and work time constraints (availability of time dimension of the updating climate measure) were not sig nificant predictors of participation in either formal or informal professional development activities. ""Lack of time"" can be characterized as a vague concept, serving as a convenient excuse.45 For many people, ""lack of time"" may reflect the value they ascribe to professional development. The librarians in the study spent about three days a year engaging in formal professional development activities and about thirty-one days a year in informal professional devel opment activities. Formal professional development is often the responsibility of the library, while informal devel opment is the responsibility of the individual. Perhaps it is time for librarians to take more responsibility for their own professional development through formal activities, partic ularly by taking advantage of Web-based courses and activ ities sponsored by professional associations.
Conclusion
We could find no empirical evidence that lack of time at work or at home acted as a significant deterrent to partici pation in professional development. Other factors, such as inconvenient scheduling or lack of information, were the significant deterrents to participation. In addition, percep tions of the library as encouraging information sharing and providing an innovative climate were significant deterrents to participation in informal professional development activities.
The onus is on librarians to take charge of their own professional development in order to provide the most effective reference service to their patrons and to enhance their competencies for reference work in the twenty-first century.

10.1108/lm-10-2017-0111,,,False,Bibi Alajmi,Understanding and motivating academic library employees: theoretical implications,"
Purpose -The purpose of this paper is to examine the levels of motivation and needs satisfaction of academic library employees, adopting Maslow's hierarchy of needs to examine individuals' motivation. Design/methodology/approach -The study collects and analyzes quantitative survey data. The research population comprises 108 employees working across eight college libraries at Kuwait University. Findings -While participants generally agreed that their needs were being satisfied at each of the five levels of Maslow's hierarchy, they reported higher levels of satisfaction of their self-actualization and social needs. Self-actualization is the summit of Maslow's motivation theory representing the quest for reaching one's full potential as a person.Research limitations/implications -One limitation is the relatively small sample size due to Kuwait having only one public university. Future research could overcome this limitation by investigating both private and public universities. Practical implications -This research contributes significantly and in various ways to understanding motivation in a library setting. It elucidates many aspects of Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory criticized in previous literature. Overall, the study's results should be useful to scholars in the library field interested in motivation, to academic librarians and to managers in academia. Originality/value -Though many prior studies have focused on motivation in a library setting, Maslow's theory has been little considered in the context of academic libraries. This study uses a theoretical framework based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs to understand and explain the levels of motivation and needs satisfaction of academic library employees.
",2019-03-11,Library Management,Emerald,"Introduction
Motivation is the management process of influencing behavior based on the knowledge of what makes people act (Luthans, 1998). It is the process that arouses, energizes, directs and sustains behavior and performance; the process of stimulating people to action to achieve a desired goal.
The significant impact of employees' motivation on organizational productivity and employees' commitment and effectiveness has been widely documented in the relevant literature (Babalola and Nwalo, 2013;Tella et al., 2007). Understanding the factors that contribute to individual behavior in the workplace can provide an organization's management with the theoretical basis upon which to initiate change and begin improvement. In particular, previous research on motivation aimed to focus on motivational determinants as a proper explanation of individual behavior (Ajzen, 2002;Ellemers et al., 2004). These studies' findings support the notion that individual behavior is influenced by salient factors underlying the attitudes and goals that give rise to actions.
Previous research has emphasized on an interesting aspect of individuals' motivation to behave and act by pointing out that motivation depends on the realization of needs (Maslow, 1943). According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, if individuals' needs and desires are realized, they will be motivated. The current study attempts to understand and explain the levels of motivation and needs satisfaction of employees working in academic libraries in Kuwait University (KU). Its investigations aim to understand to what extent academic library employees perceive that their needs are satisfied. Satisfaction, based on Maslow's theory of needs, is the key to motivation: once one's needs are met, one can be motivated to work and excel. Thus, this study is guided by the main research question:
RQ1. What are the levels of motivation and needs satisfaction of employees working in KU libraries?
Literature review
According to the theory of human motivation developed by Maslow in 1943, there are at least five sets of goals, which may be called basic needs: physiological, security, social, self-esteem and self-actualization. The theory asserts that humans are motivated by the desire to achieve or maintain the various conditions upon which these basic satisfactions rest, as well as by certain more intellectual desires (Maslow, 1943). Maslow's theory of motivation is among the theories most often adopted to understand and measure work motivation (Sadri and Bowen, 2011). Maslow's theory of motivation is based on the idea that individuals have a hierarchy of needs, starting with the most basic and important physiological necessities and ascending up to the fifth level of the need for self-actualization. In the context of employment and the workplace, the five needs can be described as follows.
Physiological needs
The needs that are usually taken as the starting point for motivation theory are the so-called physiological drives. Physiological needs are the basic needs of individuals, such as fresh air, an adequate workspace, well-designed workstations, comfortable lighting, suitable temperature, convenient food services and water.
Security needs
If employees' physiological needs are relatively well gratified, there then emerges a new set of needs, which we may categorize roughly as security needs. Providing individuals with a safe office, stable wages and salaries, job security, health insurance, and retirement benefits can satisfy these needs.
Social needs
If both the physiological and security needs are fairly well gratified, there will then emerge the social needs for love, affection and belongingness. To satisfy their social needs, particularly the need to love and be loved, employees need social activities, teamwork, friendship, a sense of belonging and affection within the workplace.
Esteem needs
Every member of society has a need or desire for a stable, firmly based and (usually) high evaluation of themselves, which is necessary for self-respect, or self-esteem and for the esteem of others. By firmly based self-esteem, we mean that which is soundly based upon real capacity, achievement and respect from others. Esteem needs may be divided into two categories. The first comprises the desire for strength, achievement and adequacy, confidence in the face of the world, and independence and freedom. The second comprises the desire for reputation and prestige, recognition, attention, importance and appreciation.
Self-actualization
Even if all of these needs are satisfied, a new discontent and restlessness often develops, unless the individual is doing what he is empowered and capable of doing. Self-actualization refers to the desire for self-fulfillment, namely, the tendency to become actualized in what 204 LM 40,3/4 one has the potential to be. This tendency might be phrased as the desire to increasingly become what one is capable of becoming. Though Maslow's theory has been little considered in the context of academic libraries, many studies have focused on motivation in a library setting (Tella et al., 2007). Most published research on motivation adopts a theoretical and philosophical approach to discuss two major themes. The first is the factors influencing individuals' motivational level. Studies considering this theme have examined the organizational and social (Ogiamien and Izuagbe, 2016), psychological (Kida et al., 2013), physiological (Abu Sheikha andYounis, 2006;Quinn, 2005) and personal components of professional work, including work environment, personality traits, self-actualization and autonomy, salary and promotions, and various other factors (Alqudsi-Ghabra and Mansouri, 2010;Bell, 2003).
The second major theme explored in the literature is the relationship between individuals' motivation level and job satisfaction, commitment and productivity. Studies investigating this relationship aim to highlight that managing people is key to successful organization management (Babalola and Nwalo, 2013;Lim, 2008). Managing people relies heavily on understanding the salient factors that motivate individuals' behavior and being able to analyze the significant impact of satisfying individuals' needs on organizational performance.
Studies investigating both themes often produce supporting results. Mallaiah and Yadapadithaya (2009), for instance, reported on the motivation level of librarians at the university libraries of Karnataka, focusing on two main factors: work and sense of personal worth. Most respondents reported taking pride in doing their jobs as well as they could, so as to feel a sense of personal satisfaction. Smith and Galbraith (2012) surveyed 500 student employees and supervisors working at the Brigham Young University's Harold B. Lee Library, seeking to understand their preferences and learn how to better work with employees and supervise them more effectively. Their results showed that the millennial generation values and is highly motivated by four main aspects of work: flexibility, personal satisfaction, meaningful work and growth opportunities. Ajie et al. (2016) aimed to determine the level of motivation among library personnel in Lagos state. Their results showed that intrinsic motivation was relatively high among respondents, who strongly agreed that their work provides opportunities for increasing their knowledge and skills, and that they are motivated by the appreciation they earn from others, and their ability to compete and excel. Dorner (2011) investigated motivation within the student assistant workforce of seven academic libraries of the Association of Research Libraries. Exploring student employee motivation within the framework of self-determination theory, her study found student assistants to have high levels of motivation stemming from enjoyment of the task at hand and their desire to seek rewards or avoid punishment. These findings reconcile with observations of prior studies that tasks allowing people to feel independent, capable and engaged are more motivating than tasks allowing for little autonomy, competence and relatedness (Gagné and Deci, 2005). More specifically, Sewell and Gilbert (2015) show that access services staff have opportunities for satisfaction of higher-level needs, the three most important of which were reported to be personal fulfillment, job opportunities and relationships with coworkers. There are also contributing factors that affect satisfaction of lower-level needs, such as salary.
On another level, as Green et al. (2000) demonstrated, having well-motivated staff is dependent on management practices that encourage communication, good workplace relationships, involvement in decision-making, adapting to change, job rotation, recognition and reward and staff training. All of these factors facilitate increasing productivity, improving work quality, raising morale, and developing new skills, knowledge, understanding and attitudes (Babalola and Nwalo, 2013;Olaniyan and Ojo, 2008).
In brief, previous studies have explained the various motivational factors for employees, and specifically academic librarians, from different perspectives. Each study emphasized the highest level of motivation within organizations. This study's purpose is to understand and explain the levels of motivation and needs satisfaction of employees working in academic libraries in KU, based on a theoretical framework adopting Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
Methodology

Sample
The research population comprised academic library staff working in KU. KU has nine academic libraries in total, comprising the Jaber AlAhmad Central Library and the libraries of eight faculties: Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Engineering and Petroleum, Faculty of Law, Faculty of Life Sciences, Faculty of Sharia and Islamic Studies, Faculty of Science and the Health Sciences Center. In total, there are 123 librarians across the nine KU libraries. However, for this study, only eight libraries were investigated: the Faculty of Education Library was excluded as it declined to participate in the study.
Research design and instrument
The study adopted a quantitative approach using the survey method as the primary tool for data collection. The survey used a self-designed questionnaire, developed based on the five levels of Maslow's theory. The survey contained two main sections. The first section comprised demographic information for the research sample, such as gender, age group, experience, education, position in the library and the academic library in which they work. The second section focused on the five levels of Maslow's hierarchy, containing statements using a five-point Likert scale (1 ¼ strong disagreement; 5 ¼ strong agreement). Statements were categorized into five subgroups according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. A reliability test was conducted on the instrument's indexes using Cronbach's α, based on a sample of 108 library staff working in eight KU libraries. Cronbach's α for each of the need levels was as follows: 0.872 for physiological, 0.701 for security, 0.934 for social, 0.765 for self-esteem and 0.923 for self-actualization. According to Straub et al. (2004), a reliability coefficient of 0.70 or above is sufficient for research purposes.
Data collection
Surveys were sent to each library through contacts in each campus. Contacts were chosen in each library campus to facilitate accessing the libraries to conduct this research. Printed surveys were used because online surveys could cause a low response rate. Thus, 123 printed surveys were distributed to the eight libraries. The surveys were collected after five working days, with 108 returned surveys in total, representing an 88 percent response rate. The data were collected and analyzed using SPSS, and the results are presented and discussed through tables, frequencies and descriptive analysis.
Findings
After collecting the surveys, we first analyzed the demographic information. Regarding gender, most of the respondents were females (66.4 percent of the total responses). The highest percentage of respondents were aged 30-39 years old (42.1 percent), followed by 40-49 years old (31.8 percent), 50-59 (13.1 percent), 20-29 (10.3 percent) and 60 and above (2.8 percent). Regarding education, most of the respondents had a university degree (60.7 percent), followed by graduate degree (18.7 percent), diploma (10.3 percent) and high school completion (9.3 percent). On years of experience, the highest number of respondents had above 16 years (37.2 percent), followed by 11-15 years (23.9 percent), 6-10 years (21.2 percent), 2-5 years (9.7 percent) and less than 2 years (2.7 percent).
A broad range of positions was represented among the sample, comprising 33 percent library assistants and technicians, 31.1 percent library directors, 22.6 percent librarians, 206 LM 40,3/4 3.8 percent library managers and 9.4 percent other professions. Most of the respondents worked in the Health Sciences Center and Jaber AlAhmad Central Library (both 32.4 percent), followed by the Library of Arts (7.4 percent), Library of Sharia and Islamic Studies (6.5 percent), and Faculty of Life Science Library (6.5 percent), Library of Engineering and Petroleum (5.6 percent) and Library of Science and Library of Law (both 4.6 percent).
Level of motivation
The group mean and standard deviation were calculated for each of Maslow's needs levels. The group means are presented in descending order, with Maslow's order to enable comparison. A five-point Likert scale (1 ¼ strong disagreement; 5 ¼ strong agreement) was used to measure participants' level of agreement with each statement. Table I provides details of the results for each of Maslow's needs levels of motivation.
As indicated by the results presented in Table I, the group means of Maslow's needs ranged between 4.022 and 3.393. At the highest level, results found strong satisfaction of participants' self-actualization needs (M ¼ 4.022, SD ¼ 0.950). Satisfaction of the social (M ¼ 3.801, SD ¼ 1.061), physiological (M ¼ 3.738, SD ¼ 0.979) and security (M ¼ 3.592, SD ¼ 0.902) needs levels was reported to be relatively high, while self-esteem needs scored the lowest mean (M ¼ 3.393, SD ¼ 0.871), indicating more modest need satisfaction.
As clearly indicated in the results of Table I, the current research findings do not match the hierarchical order presented by Maslow's theory of human behavior. Remarkably, self-actualization, theoretically supposed to be the highest-level need in Maslow's pyramid, is ranked as the most satisfied in this study's findings. Contrary to Maslow's theory that the basic physical necessities are most important (Maslow, 1943), these findings emphasize self-actualization needs as the most important for individuals to perform better in their work. One explanation is that when a person is promoted to higher levels, their lower-level needs become less important for them (Nemati, 2013). Alternatively, culture might be a mediating factor, such that different results may be found when applying Maslow's hierarchy of needs in different societies (Gambrel and Cianci, 2003). Overall, this study's empirical findings do not support the concept of the hierarchy of needs, nor it was meant to test it statistically. Previous studies, while acknowledging that human beings do have needs to be met, provide sparse empirical evidence for the hierarchical order of needs proposed by Maslow (Wahba and Bridwell, 1976); the existence of a rigid order of needs for every individual has also been questioned (King-Hill, 2015).
Physiological needs
This is the first level in Maslow's hierarchy. In academic libraries, this level of need will be satisfied through various means including fresh air in the library, adequate workspaces, well-designed workstations, comfortable lighting, suitable temperature, food and drinks facilities and the availability of tools and stationery. In response to all six statements in this category, the majority of the study's participants indicated that their physiological needs were sufficiently satisfied. Table II presents descriptive statistics of responses for the physiological needs level.
As Table II shows 75 percent of participants reported agreement or strong agreement that their work environment is comfortable (M ¼ 3.94). In addition, 73.8 percent agreed or 
207
Motivating academic library employees strongly agreed that the features necessary for a comfortable working environment, such as ventilation, lighting, air conditioning and furniture were available (M ¼ 3.89).
Regarding food facilities, modern technological equipment, and office tools and stationary, most respondents reported agreement or strong agreement that each is sufficiently available, comprising 73.4, 71.6 and 66 percent, respectively. Generally, participants indicated that their physiological needs were being met at work (M ¼ 3.738, SD ¼ 0.979), thus corroborating the findings of previous studies that professional and non-professional personnel are motivated if given the work environment and incentives they need and deserve (Tella et al., 2007).
Security needs
This is the second level in Maslow's hierarchy. In this context, it focuses on the needs that must be fulfilled for librarians to feel safe and secure, including having a safe office, stable wages and salaries, job security, health insurance and retirement benefits. Table III presents descriptive statistics of responses for the security needs level.
As shown in Table III, levels of agreement were high for statements related to workplace safety, job security and feeling of peace at work (73.8, 82.7 and 78.2 percent, respectively). However, more than 55 percent of respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement concerning their employer's provision of health needs (M ¼ 2.42). Overall, the respondents generally perceive that security needs are fulfilled in their respective libraries (M ¼ 3.592, SD ¼ 0.902). These results reconcile with previous findings on the impact of security needs, including job security and a stable salary, on job satisfaction and motivation: greater benefits have been found to be associated with higher employee satisfaction levels (Horenstein, 1993;Lim, 2008;Machara and Jain, 2016). As shown in Table IV, more than 60 percent of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed with all seven statements. The highest levels of agreement (including strong agreement) were found for statements related to trust between employees and their managers (more than 80 percent, M ¼ 4.14), encouragement of developing social relationships among colleagues (73 percent, M ¼ 3.89), fostering a sense of belonging in the workplace (75.3 percent, M ¼ 3.98) and coworkers helping one another (71.8 percent, M ¼ 3.84). In general, there was a high level of agreement among participants that their social needs were being fulfilled at work (M ¼ 3.801, SD ¼ 1.061). Yet, feeling of belongings and identifying with work as a team member were significantly related to motivation and job satisfaction. Lim (2008) found a sense of belonging, faith in wanting to belong and feeling of acceptance to be positively related to job satisfaction. Similarly, in a study of job satisfaction among US academic librarians, Mirfakhrai (1991) found that supervisory and coworker relationships, as well as the work itself, strongly influenced overall satisfaction.
Self-esteem needs
This is the fourth level in Maslow's hierarchy. In this context, it comprises needs concerning self-image and self-worth including receiving recognition, awards, and respect from the management. Table V presents descriptive statistics of responses for the self-esteem needs level.
As shown in Table V, most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that there is appreciation and mutual respect between employees and their managers (82 percent, M ¼ 4.13) and that managers appreciate employees' work effort and loyalty (81.3 percent, M ¼ 4.13). Most respondents also agreed or strongly agreed that they were satisfied with their job titles (69 percent, M ¼ 3.68). However, 49.5 percent disagreed or strongly disagreed that the library rewards employees (M ¼ 2.63). There was also a high level of disagreement (including strong) regarding the library often holds ceremonies to honor the employee of the year (51.8 percent, M ¼ 2.37). Finally, 67.3 percent agreed or strongly agreed that they felt wanted for their professional knowledge and competence (M ¼ 3.67). Overall, there was moderate agreement among participants that their self-esteem needs were being fulfilled in their respective libraries (M ¼ 3.393, SD ¼ 0.871). Previous studies have demonstrated the significant impact of self-esteem needs, recognition and rewards on employees' job satisfaction and performance (Peng et al., 2010;Machara and Jain, 2016).

Motivating academic library employees
Self-actualization needs This is the fifth and highest level in Maslow's hierarchy focusing on self-acceptance and accomplishment. In the library context, satisfying this level of need requires providing librarians with different utilities to develop themselves and the library. Table VI presents descriptive statistics of responses for the self-actualization needs level.
As shown in Table VI, for all six statements, the highest percentage of respondents reported strong agreement. The highest level of agreement (including strong) was reported for consistently employing skills in the job (83.4 percent, M ¼ 4.27), followed by consistently seeking to help the library achieve its goals (82.7 percent, M ¼ 4.20) and then feeling proud and honored to be performing their work (80.3 percent, M ¼ 4.21). A total of 73 percent agreed or strongly agreed that they search for new learning opportunities (M ¼ 3.96). In general, participants reported very high agreement that their self-actualization needs were being fulfilled at work (M ¼ 4.022, SD ¼ 0.950). These results support previous findings on library staff engagement in work and decision-making. For example, in prior studies, the best predictors of library employees' satisfaction were the extent to which they perceive they are: involved in library planning and decision-making; consulted about factors directly relating to their job responsibilities and work environment; informed about matters affecting the library; and in control of their own activities (Horenstein, 1993;Leckie and Brett, 1997). Discussion For this study, Maslow's hierarchy of needs was adopted to develop understanding of the levels of motivation and needs satisfaction among employees of KU's academic libraries.
Maslow's theory is based on the idea that individuals work to satisfy human needs, such as physiological requirements and self-esteem. He emphasized an interesting aspect of individuals' needs by identifying that motivation depends on their realization: Maslow believed that if individuals' needs and desires were realized, they would be motivated. Through a questionnaire survey instrument, this study's investigations focused on the extent to which various needs of employees working in academic libraries are satisfied. Satisfaction, based on Maslow's theory of needs, is the key to motivation: once employees' needs are met, they can be motivated to work and excel. Based on the study's overall findings, the academic libraries' employees perceive that their needs are generally being satisfied. This study's results identify a clear distinction between different types of motivations that, once understood, could untangle the causes of human behavior and predict individuals' future actions. According to Maslow's theory of needs, many individuals possess active higher-order needs for esteem and self-actualization. His theory suggests that individuals may be motivated to perform certain tasks without an apparent need for external reward. In this study, self-actualization and social needs have shown strong evidence of motivation among academic library staff.
Further analysis of the results emphasizes the significant importance of intrinsic motivation for employees working in academic libraries. While participants generally agreed that their needs for extrinsic motivation were being satisfied, they reported higher levels of satisfaction of their self-actualization and social needs, reflecting intrinsic motivation. Self-actualization is the summit of Maslow's motivation theory representing the quest for reaching one's full potential as a person.
This motivation level entails providing opportunities for employees to reach their full career potential. Work factors including a sense of personal satisfaction, pride in doing the job and creative ways of working have been found to be major factors that influence individuals' job performance (Mallaiah and Yadapadithaya, 2009). Investigating job satisfaction at a South African university library, Hart's (2010) fundamental finding was that the core work of an academic library, namely, serving the information needs of academics and students, is the major source of job satisfaction. The everyday challenge of new learning is another strong motivator.
Self-actualization refers to the need to become all that one is capable of being; to seek personal growth and peak experiences. In the work context, the rationale for promoting self-actualization is that self-actualized employees represent valuable assets for the organization. To meet their employees' need for self-actualization, library managers must show employees that they are valued and respected and should create a supportive environment.
These findings assert that librarianship is a rewarding profession (Bell, 2003). By providing services to their community, librarians enjoy moments of supreme satisfaction and self-reward. It is through moments of embracing their passions that academic librarians are motivated to explore. However, as previous research warns having identified a passion for academic librarianship in their employees, the challenge for leadership is to sustain it.
Conclusion and research implications
This study aimed to examine the levels of motivation and needs satisfaction of academic libraries' employees. The study's results should be useful to scholars in the library field interested in motivation, to academic librarians and to managers in academia.
This research contributes significantly and in various ways to understanding motivation in a library setting. By adopting Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory by itself an addition to the literature of motivation, the research elucidates many aspects of the theory criticized in previous literature. For example, one of the major criticisms of Maslow's theory is the rigidity of the hierarchy of needs, which finds little empirical support in prior studies (King-Hill, 2015;Wahba and Bridwell, 1976). In fact, scholars have been encouraged to revise Maslow's pyramid to reflect the development of human societies over time and the new perspectives and technologies changing human personalities (Nemati, 2013). Overall, scholars in the library and information science field should focus on the impact of the changing library environment of the 21st century on librarians' level of motivation and job satisfaction. Work identification, teamwork, self-actualization and sense of belongings are all key issues in the new workspace environment that warrant further investigation.
For managers of academic libraries, stereotypes can create negative or unrealistic views of the nature of a library workspace, traditionally perceived as rigid and unimaginative. Management should, instead, perceive the library environment as a space for embracing creativity and fostering innovation (Olson, 1999), both for employees and patrons. To achieve this shift in their organizations, library management needs to focus on various aspects ( Jantz, 2012). Primarily, employees must be recognized as key to organizational success. Librarians and other information professionals have to be engaged in decision-making processes. Support must be routinely provided to librarians on a daily basis. They also need more opportunities to use their skills and to be creative and innovative.
For librarians and other information professionals working in academia, this study found that employees' needs satisfaction are deeply based on their desire to increasingly become what they are capable of becoming, their desire for self-fulfillment. While the workspace is required to create an enabling environment for self-fulfillment, to encourage collaboration, and nurture motivation, librarians and other professionals need to be willing to contribute to and engage in the different types of activities and projects in their libraries. Their engagement and contribution are valuable to the continuous improvement and development of their motivation and needs satisfaction.",5727,6508
10.1515/9783598440168.3.157,,Chan and Auster 2005,True,Chan,Understanding Librarians Motivation to Participate in Professional Development Activites,,2005,,,"Introduction\nIn twenty first century libraries, change has become a constant. The introduction of new technologies has enabled the reorganization of work processes and the development of new products and services. In addition, new ways of managing organizations have been introduced. This has led to restructuring, downsizing and the search for flexibility in staffing. The knowledge and skills that workers had acquired through education and on-the-job experience may no longer be relevant for jobs that have been changed by technology or that have been redesigned. Libraries expect staff to take up these challenges and opportunities and learn to adopt new roles, innovate new services and master new technologies by actively pursuing professional development and workplace learning opportunities. This paper examines the crucial role of motivation in the participation of staff in professional development activities. We review the literature on motivation to learn and to participate in professional development and present results of a study that explores the extent to which professional development of reference librarians was occurring in large public libraries in Ontario, Canada. We examine components of motivation in order to understand the motivational processes of librarians. Our discussion focuses on the meaning of the results for the policies and practices relating to professional development in libraries in the twenty first century.\nReview of the literature\nAcross several disciplines and despite varied conceptualizations, motivation emerges as the single most important determinant of participation in training and professional development activities. This finding is consistent across the industrial psychology and education literatures where motivation has been measured as simply as a desire to learn or as complexly as a mathematical construct based on expectancy theory. In addition, researchers have focused on the predictors of motivation.\nMotivation is the process relating to the category of outcomes an individual wants to achieve or to avoid as well as to the specific actions necessary to attain this. 1 In relation to participation in training and development activities, motivation to learn is an employee\'s desire to learn the content of training and development activities. 2 In one study, motivation to learn was the only attitudinal variable to have a consistent, positive effect on participation in development activities across three different organizations. 2 In another study, learning motivation was found to be significantly correlated with participation in five types of development activities. 3 Researchers have asked trainees directly about their motivation to participate in the training or development activity being undertaken. Smith and Burgin 4 asked 731 library professionals and paraprofessionals about their reasons for participating in continuing education programs. They identified four factors, professional competence, patron service, collegiality and personal concerns, as motivators.\nMotivation has been conceptualized using expectancy theory. 5 Expectancy theory predicts that behaviour results from choices individuals make, based on the kinds and levels of rewards they expect to attain and the effort required to obtain the rewards. According to the theory, individuals will be motivated to participate in updating to acquire new knowledge or skills if they:\n1. believe that participation in updating activities will result in their being up-todate and competent (expectancy belief); 2.\nperceive that being up-to-date will influence the kinds of work-related outcomes such as pay, promotion, praise or feelings of accomplishment they can obtain (instrumentality belief); 3.\nvalue the work-related outcomes (valence).\nExpectancy theory predicts that the three factors (expectancy beliefs, instrumentality beliefs and valences) combine in a multiplicative fashion to provide motivation to a course of action. Motivation is expected to be greatest when high levels of effort are perceived to be associated with high levels of performance, which in turn lead to valued outcomes, such as higher pay. This formulation has been used in studies of engineers, 6 administrative staff, 7 nurses, 8 information systems professionals 9 and public servants 10 and their participation in training and development activities. In all these studies, motivation was a significant predictor of participation.\nThe antecedents of training, including training motivation, have been widely studied. A meta-analysis of training motivation drew on 256 studies to examine the predictors of motivation and the ways in which motivation influences various outcomes related to participation in training and development. These studies have identified individual characteristics, such as achievement motivation, locus of control, job involvement, organizational commitment, career commitment, self-efficacy, valence and age, as significant predictors of training motivation. Situational characteristics, such as organizational climate, manager support and peer support also play a role in determining training motivation. These characteristics have been linked also to training behaviour (e.g., participation levels) and training outcomes (e.g., knowledge and skill acquisition, reactions to training). The study focused on alternative constructs to model the antecedents of training motivation and outcomes of training. The meta-analysis suggested that motivation mediates the effect certain variables, such as self-efficacy, valence and job involvement, while other variables, such as locus of control, conscientiousness, anxiety, age and climate, exert both direct and indirect effects on motivation, learning outcomes and job performance. 11\nMethodology\nThe data used in this paper were collected from reference librarians working in 18 large urban public libraries in Ontario, Canada in 2001. A total of 733 professional librarians with reference responsibilities were sent questionnaires and 553 completed responses were received, for a response rate of 75.4%. The objective of the study was to examine the influence of individual characteristics and organizational factors on the participation of librarians in formal and informal professional development activities.\nProfessional development activities included on the questionnaire were both formal and informal. Formal activities are scheduled and structured learning activities, such as inhouse training courses, continuing education courses at an educational institution or professional association workshops. Informal activities are learning activities that occur opportunistically, without strict timetables, and outside of formal structures. 12,13 These include discussions with colleagues, reading professional literature, writing/editing for publication, on-the-job training, attending conferences and self-directed projects.\nThe other variables in the conceptual framework include motivation; professional commitment (the extent to which an individual identifies with his/her profession); barriers to participation (the personal circumstances that restrict an individual\'s ability to participate in updating activities); climate (employees\' perceptions that management policies and practices influence participation in professional development); managerial support (the perception that managers and supervisors in the organization actively support employees in their efforts to keep up-to-date); and, age. Control variables included full/part-time work status and size of the organization. The operationalization of the measures is described in the appendix.\nMultiple regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between participation in professional development activities and the control and independent variables. Each participation measure (formal activities and informal activities) was regressed on the control variables (full/part-time status and size of organization) and the independent variables (motivation, age, subjective age, professional commitment, barriers to participation, updating climate and managerial support). Multiple regression analysis was also used to examine the relationship between motivation and the control and independent variables. Listwise deletion was used to handle missing data. This resulted in varying sample sizes, from 477 to 512, for each of the equations. To examine the components of the motivation measure, t-tests of difference of means and Spearman\'s rank correlation were used.\nResults\nThere were 553 respondents to the survey, representing 75.4% of the survey population. All respondents included in the analysis have professional qualifications (BLS, MLS or equivalent) and are identified as having some public service responsibilities. The respondents are predominantly female (82.5%), work full-time (77.9%), are members of a professional association (51.9%) and are union members (80.5%). Over half of respondents (58.1%) had been employed as a librarian for 15 years or longer.\nRespondents reported an average of 26.4 hours in the previous year in formal updating activities, and an average of 247.7 hours in informal activities. The main type of formal updating activity was in-house courses while the main informal updating activity was conference attendance, followed by discussions with colleagues.\nThe average motivation score was 54.0, with a standard deviation of 18.7. The motivation scores ranged in value from 2.2 to 112.0. Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation scores were also calculated based on the types of rewards for participating in professional development. Intrinsic rewards were personal satisfaction, development of new knowledge, challenging tasks, preparation for future work and networking with other librarians. Extrinsic rewards were pay, recognition, job security, promotion opportunities and influence over work decisions. The intrinsic motivation score averaged 70.9, with a standard deviation of 25.6; the extrinsic motivation score averaged 37.0, with a standard deviation 17.1. The difference between these two scores was significant (t=45.88, p=.000).\nTable 1 presents the results of the regression of the participation variables on motivation and the independent and control variables. The table shows the standardized regression coefficients for motivation, R 2 for the model, the F-value for the model R 2 , p value, and the sample size. The details of the results for the other independent and the control variables are not shown. For all equations, the model R 2 is significant. For participation in formal activities, F=6.31 (df=8, 468, p=0.000), and for participation in informal activities, F=9.61 (df=8, 496, p=0.000). Note: Other independent variables included are full/part-time status, size of organization, years in profession, professional commitment, barriers to participation, updating climate, managerial support.\nTable 1 Regression results for participation variables\nMotivation is a significant predictor of participation in both formal professional development activities (Î²=.11, p=0.028) and informal activities (Î²=.20, p=0.000). The effect of motivation is positive. The equations predict that for every unit increase in motivation, participation in formal activities will increase 0.10 hours and participation in informal activities will increase 1.80 hours.\nTable 2 presents the results of the regression of motivation and the independent and control variables. The table shows the standardized regression coefficients for the independent variables, R 2 for the model, the F-value for the model R 2 and the sample size. The model R 2 (0.24) is significant, F=19.53, (df=8, 503, p=0.000) The independent variables are all significant predictors of motivation to participate in professional development activities. Professional commitment (Î²=.13, p=0.001), barriers to participation (Î²=.16, p=0.000), climate (Î²=.26, p=0.000) and managerial support (Î²=.15, p=0.001) all have a positive effect on motivation. This suggests that the level of motivation is affected by the perceived climate of support for professional development in the library and by the degree of support from the manager. Age, as measured by years in the profession (Î²=-.11, p=0.004) has a negative effect on motivation.\nAn examination of the components of the motivation measure, expectancies, instrumentalities and valences, allows us to understand more fully the motivation of librarians to participate in professional development. Table 3 shows descriptive statistics for the expectancy component of the motivation measure. This component reflects the perceived benefits of participation. On a scale from 1 to 5, respondents perceived that they would almost always obtain these outcomes from participation in professional development. Better service to patrons received the highest ranking at 4.30, and higher productivity received the lowest ranking at 3.99. The valence component reflects the perceived value of the rewards from participating in professional development, and can be characterised as what respondents want from the organization for participating in professional development. The instrumentality component reflects the expectations of receiving these same rewards as a result of participating in professional development, and can be characterised as what employees think they get from the organization for participating in professional development activities.\nTable 4 presents the comparison between the valence (\'wants\') and instrumentality (\'gets\') components of motivation. The ranking of the \'wants\' list shows that the top three valued rewards were intrinsic (satisfaction, new knowledge and preparation for future work), followed by three extrinsic rewards (job security, influence over work decisions and pay).\nHowever, the ranking of the \'gets\' list shows that all the intrinsic rewards were thought to be the most likely to be obtained and the extrinsic rewards ranked in the bottom half of the list. The significance of the \'wants\' and \'gets\' rankings can be assessed using Spearman\'s rank correlation of association (Spearman\'s Rho, r s ). Spearman\'s rank correlation applies to ranked data; a value of one indicates that the two rankings are identical, and a value near zero indicates no association between the two sets of rankings. A significant correlation would indicate that the level of association between the two rankings is different from zero. In this case, the overall correlation between the two sets of rankings was 0.41, indicating a nonsignificant level of association between the two groups (p=0.243).\nThe reward which received the highest average ranking in terms of importance was personal satisfaction at 4.53, on a scale of 1 to 5. However, the reward which was rated most likely to be obtained was new professional knowledge and skills at 4.38 on a scale of 1 to 5. Personal satisfaction was the second reward that was most likely to be obtained. Job security ranked fourth in the list of \'wants\'; however it ranked second last in terms of \'gets\'. In other words, job security was quite highly valued by the respondents but it was recognized that it was not likely to be obtained by participation in professional development. Looking at the individual rewards, respondents valued them as important (>3) while their expectations of obtaining these rewards ranged from 4 (likely) to 1 (not at all likely). These gaps between the \'wants\' and the \'gets\' are significant for all rewards, except for networking opportunities. In most cases, the value of the reward had a higher rating than the expectation of receiving the reward. For example, pay was rated as \'important\' (3.90), but the likelihood of obtaining a pay increase through participation in professional development was ranked as not at all likely (1.22; t=66.30, p=.000). Of the significant differences, only new professional skills scored a higher rating on the \'gets\' list (4.38) compared to the \'wants\' list (4.25; t=-4.03, p=.000).\nWe now turn to examination of the motivation measures by selected characteristics. Table 5 shows comparisons of the means of the motivation measures by gender, years in the profession and union membership. The level of motivation of women is significantly higher than that for men (t=2.98, p=0.003); for librarians who have spent less than 15 years in the profession (t=1.97, p=0.049); and, for librarians who are not union members (t=-2.91, p=.004). Women and men differ significantly on their level of intrinsic motivation (t=4.62, p=0.000), but the difference in their level of extrinsic motivation is not significant. Librarians in the early half of their career show higher levels of extrinsic motivation (t=2.00, p=0.045). Union members show lower levels of extrinsic motivation than non-members (t=-4.47, p=0.000). Comparisons of the components of motivation by membership in professional associations are shown in Table 6. There are significant differences in the ratings of \'wants\' and \'gets\' according to membership in a professional organization, although the rankings of the sets of rewards are highly correlated. Both members and non-members of professional associations ranked the set of \'wants\' in a similar manner (Spearman\'s Rho, r s =0.79, p=.006) and the set of \'gets\' in the identical order (Spearman\'s Rho, r s =1.0).\nHowever, the ratings of the individual rewards on the \'wants\' list differ significantly for seven of the items. For six of the significant items, members of professional associations value the reward more highly than non-members. These items are personal satisfaction (4.60 for members vs. 4 \nDiscussion\nThe results of this study show that reference librarians working in large urban public libraries in Ontario are participating in formal and informal professional development activities. On average, librarians spent 26.4 hours in the previous year in formal updating activities and 247.7 hours in informal activities. The 1994 International Adult Literacy Survey showed that on average, in Canada, full-time employed workers with post-secondary education received 63 hours of training (predominantly formal) in the previous year. 14 Canadian surveys of informal learning have found that professional employees spend about 6 hours per week or 312 hours per year on informal work-related learning. 12 The amount of time spent by reference librarians in this study in informal learning seems to be comparable to the time spent by other professionals and by the general population of Canadians. The librarians in the study, however, report spending fewer hours in formal learning activities than other well educated workers.\nBased on an average workday of 8 hours, librarians in the study spent just over three days in the previous year attending formal professional development activities. This may be due to a lack of interest or to a lack of library-related formal professional development opportunities. Formal activities are provided by the employer, educational institutions and professional associations. Many of the library systems in the study were not large enough to be able to provide many formal in-house courses, yet these types of opportunities were the most heavily used of the formal professional development activities. On average, librarians spent about two of their three days attending in-house professional development activities. There seems to be a reliance on the employer to provide formal development opportunities.\nThe study also sheds light on the motivations of librarians to participate in professional development activities. An organizational climate that facilitates participation and a supportive manager are both positive influences on motivation. Managerial support is an important influence on motivation, possibly through the manager\'s functions of organizing, directing and co-ordinating work. Supportive managers are those who provide feedback on job performance, assign opportunities to develop and strengthen new skills and take an interest in the career goals of their staff. Respondents in the study mentioned the heavy workload of librarians. For example, one wrote: ""There needs to be more encouragement from management to have professionals take the time during the workday to explore new technologies on their own."" Clearly, having a supportive manager who enables practice and experimentation results in higher levels of informal updating. Other positive influences include commitment to the profession and, surprisingly, personal barriers to participation, while age had a negative influence on motivation.\nThe librarians in this study valued all the rewards fairly highly, but their expectations of receiving the rewards were rated as fairly unlikely. According to the expectancy theory of motivation, when individuals perceive a low probability of obtaining a reward that is valued by them they are less likely to be motivated to achieve the outcome. For the majority of the rewards, this gap between the \'wants\' and \'gets\' existed. There is an opportunity for libraries to influence motivation to participate in professional development by paying attention to the rewards they offer for professional development. One participant wrote, ""If there were some sort of recognition in terms of promotion/pay/participation in decision-making, I would be more willing to \'give up\' some family time for professional updating activities"". Another stated, ""There is no, absolutely no incentive to remain updated or to continue with professional development -no pay incentive, no work incentive, no recognition of any kind within the organization. The only incentive is my own personal sense of accomplishment and competency"".\nThe study showed that there are differences in motivation scores by gender and there was some indication of inequality of treatment on gender lines. One female noted that in terms of reimbursement of tuition fees, ""The inequality is divided on gender lines, leaving women with more of the load to bear as far as tuition fees are concerned."" A male librarian commented that ""no male librarians have been promoted in 12 years"". Perhaps libraries need to re-examine their policies and practices for these effects.\nUnion membership plays a role in motivation, with librarians who are not unionized showing higher levels of motivation, particularly extrinsic motivation. In unionized workplaces, the reliance on the seniority principle for promotion and pay increases reduces the effectiveness of extrinsic rewards.\nAge also plays a motivating role. Age, whether a chronological measure in terms of years or a psycho-social measure in terms of feelings of age, was negatively related to motivation. There were significant differences in the expectations of receiving rewards between older and younger librarians. Perhaps one of the stereotypes of older workers is true in libraries: older workers are not interested in investing the time and effort it takes to learn on their own. Libraries need to consider their human resource practices and how they affect the older workers on their staff. In particular, valued rewards for older workers to update may be somewhat different from that of younger workers. The key is to find out what employees value and to design rewards that truly motivate.\nMembership in professional associations is an important factor influencing motivation to participate in professional development. The differences between members and nonmembers were significant for all rewards in terms of \'wants\' (value of the rewards) and in terms of \'gets\' (likelihood of obtaining the reward). Some libraries subsidize the cost of membership for professional staff and/or attendance at professional conferences and workshops but the policies may not be evenly applied. One respondent told us, ""Conferences were offered to staff members, but not fully reimbursed financially for attending. This often limited the number of interested staff members, including myself. [It was] never clear that time would be offered in lieu of time spent at off-hours workshops, conferences"". Another said, ""Conference attendance seems to be generally limited to managers, in terms of staff who are encouraged to go. \'Regular\' librarians have to make a special request, justify why they should be \'allowed\' to go and may not be reimbursed for fees (only their time, if they are lucky)"". Many participants indicated that their library does not reward or recognize them for their membership of professional associations.\nThere was also a perception held by some librarians that professional associations had nothing to offer them. One librarian wrote, ""My biggest concern is that our professional association is not providing activities that meet my needs. The sessions that are offered tend to rehash the problems but offer no solutions. I\'m not looking for the questions, but I am looking for some answers or suggestions"".\nThis exploratory study focused on a selected group of librarians in public libraries in a particular geographical region. Future research could expand the scope of coverage. A case study of informal learning in the workplace would be of benefit. This would allow a more indepth examination of the factors found to be significant in this study together with additional variables that might influence informal learning. Causal modeling of the process of maintaining professional competence can be accomplished through longitudinal studies.\nLimitations\nNot all possible explanatory variables were included in the study. There are other variables such as self-efficacy, co-worker support and organizational commitment, which have been found to have an influence on motivation in previous studies. The study uses selfreported data that are retrospective in nature. It is known that there is considerable difference between self-reported data on participation in all types of training and development activities and data obtained from administrative records of participation in formal training. 2,15 There is much measurement error in on-the-job training measures, with organizations reporting up to 25% more training on average than do workers. 15 \nConclusion\nThis study focused on the participation of reference librarians in professional development activities and their motivations to keep up-to-date. Motivation is a significant predictor of participation levels. Librarians were motivated to participate by their expectations of providing better service for their patrons and greater competence in their work. There were significant gaps between the value they place on the rewards for professional development and their perceptions of their ability to obtain the rewards. Membership in a professional association was found to affect the librarians\' perceptions of the rewards for updating. Libraries can improve their policies and practices for making professional development opportunities available to their staff, for creating an organizational climate that is supportive of learning, and for recognizing the efforts of their staff to keep up-to-date. In the words of one librarian, ""The challenges of the new work environment have reinvigorated my career. The learning curve has become steeper, especially in the last 5-6 years. All in all, though, it\'s been great fun and has provided immense job satisfaction. My enthusiasm for being a professional librarian has increased immensely"".\nAppendix. Measures used in the study Participation in professional development activities\nRespondents were asked to estimate the number of hours they had spent in the previous year engaging in the different types of formal professional development activities. For informal activities, they were asked to estimate the number of hours in the previous month they had spent participating in each type of activity. This estimate was multiplied by 12 to yield an estimate of hours spent in the previous year in each activity. The measure of participation in formal and informal activities represents the sum of hours spent in these styles of professional development.\nMotivation\nThe measure of motivation was based on expectancy theory. 5,16 Motivation is conceived as a multiplicative function of three factors:\n1.\nExpectancy: the belief that participating in professional development activities will lead to better performance, given a certain level of effort, 2.\nInstrumentality: the expectation of receiving an outcome, given successful performance, 3.\nValence: the value of that outcome. Expectancy was operationalized by asking respondents to estimate how frequently a high level of participation in professional development activities leads to higher productivity, enhanced performance, better service for patrons/clients and greater competence on the job. These were ranked on a scale from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always).\nInstrumentality was operationalized by asking respondents to rate the likelihood of attaining certain outcomes if they frequently participated in professional development activities. The rating scale ran from 1 (not at all likely) to 5 (extremely likely).\nValence was operationalized by asking respondents to rate the importance of the same outcomes. The rating scale ran from 1 (not at all important) to 5 (extremely important). For the Instrumentality and Valence measures, the same set of 10 outcomes was used. The outcomes consisted of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. The intrinsic rewards were personal satisfaction, development of new knowledge, challenging tasks, preparation for future work and networking with other librarians. The extrinsic rewards were pay, recognition, job security, promotion opportunities and influence over work decisions.\nAge\nThere were five measures of age. Chronological age, time to retirement, and years in the profession conceptualize age in terms of years.

Professional Development through Academic Course Transformation
In Short
• IMPACT is a comprehensive multi-year campus-wide collaborative effort designed to achieve greater student-centered learning environments by incorporating a variety of student-centered teaching and learning practices into courses. • Since 2011, 321 faculty from every academic college or school at the Purdue West Lafayette campus participated in professional development activities within an IMPACT faculty learning community (FLC). • The IMPACT program recognizes that the needs of faculty and students in each course may differ.
Informed by self-determination theory, every transformation is tailored to the needs of the faculty member, students, and the course. • Students exposed to highly student-centered classrooms developed in IMPACT report significantly higher levels of perceived competence, ability to transfer knowledge to other relevant courses and experiences, higher learning gains, and higher motivation. • Faculty interviews and focus groups show that faculty view IMPACT as a valuable source of professional development that positively impacts both their own teaching practice and student outcomes.
U.S. colleges and universities
are facing the challenges of eroding public confidence and financial support, along with high failure rates, especially at a time when increasing numbers of students are matriculating. The demographic profile of students going to college is also more diverse, with students coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. First generation students perform worse than their peers; many students begin their postsecondary studies not ""college ready."" And employers report that many graduates are not prepared for the workplace. These issues are even more critical as postsecondary education is increasingly required for economic opportunity.
To increase student success, institutions have directed substantial resources toward infrastructure that surrounds the classroom (advising, LMS analytics, targeted inclusion programs, supplemental instruction). They have largely ignored the process of classroom teaching and learning in the classroom. George Mehaffy (2018) describes this gap as the ""doughnut hole."" He argues that academic leaders must pay more attention to quality teaching-how to improve it, foster it, and reward improvements in it (Mehaffy, 2018).
Efforts to improve undergraduate education must target what transpires in classrooms across the entire institution. Classrooms initiatives must be engaging, relevant, and appealing to a diverse group of faculty and instructors. With a growing number of non-tenure track faculty providing the teaching workforce in higher education and an increasingly diverse student body, faculty require support to effectively implement these initiatives and practices and move institutions toward true culture change.
Such initiatives must also adapt to a broad range of disciplines so they can impact a large number of students across the institution. To positively impact student engagement, motivation, and learning, instructors must utilize ""high impact"" practices that do not simply conform to policies or allow one to ""check a box."" (Kuh, O'Donnell, & Schneider, 2017;Kuh, Schneider, & Association of American Colleges Universities, 2008).
Purdue University's IMPACT Program
While many universities are prioritizing active learning and student success, few are doing so at campus-wide scale. Rarely do universities, especially research-focused universities, attempt large scale efforts over the time required to systematically improve the quality of undergraduate education. This is especially true for faculty and instructors who have not received much support in teaching prior to their first teaching experience.
The Purdue University ""Instruction Matters: Purdue Academic Course Transformation"" (IMPACT) initiative is an exception. IMPACT is a comprehensive multi-year campus-wide collaborative effort designed to achieve greater student-centered learning environments by incorporating active and collaborative learning as well as other studentcentered teaching and learning practices and technologies into courses. The creation of a student-centered learning environment aims to foster student engagement and student competence, as well as increased attainment of course-specific learning outcomes, retention, and degree completion.
Specifically, the goals of the IMPACT program can be summarized as follows:
1 Since 2011, 321 faculty from every academic college or school at the Purdue West Lafayette campus participated in professional development activities within an IMPACT Faculty Learning Community (FLC). A total of 15 semesters of FLCs were offered since the inception of the program, with an average of 21 faculty participating in each cohort. The faculty involved in IMPACT have transformed 301 unique courses while participating in an FLC. After participation in the program, using the skills and knowledge they acquired, faculty went on to transform an additional 232 courses, referred to as ""IMPACT-Influenced"" courses. Some of these influenced courses were transformed with the help of the support team, but in many instances, faculty incorporated effective student-centered teaching and transformed courses on their own. This work initially targeted lower division, large foundational undergraduate courses, so we could maximize the impact of the transformations to support the success of students during their initial years at the university. Since then, a more diverse set of courses have been transformed through the program, some considered large traditional enrollment and some with high DFW rates, although those are not requirements to be part of the IMPACT program.
As the count of transformed courses grew, so too did the rate of students exposed to an IMPACT experience. Ninetyfive percent of first-time, full-time-enrolled students who first enrolled at Purdue in fall 2016 experienced an IMPACT redesigned course within their first year at Purdue. By summer 2018, almost 60,000 different students had enrolled in at least one course redesigned as part of the IMPACT initiative. This constitutes over 70 percent of all Purdue undergraduate students who were enrolled in at least one course since fall 2011.
Over time, IMPACT courses have generally lead to an improvement in student GPAs and a reduction in DFW rates. For IMPACT courses surveyed between spring 2014 and spring 2017, a correlation between students' rating of the student-centered learning environment and mean final grade was observed (IMPACT Management Team & IMPACT Assessment Team, 2017). During the 2017 academic year, DFW rates were also improved for 9 out of 12 large, foundational, high failure courses (IMPACT Management Team & IMPACT Assessment Team, 2017).
Keys to Success
Over the past seven years, we have learned some important lessons as we carried out this work and sought to continuously improve the program and the faculty learning communities. These include tailoring course changes to faculty and student needs-including the necessity of cultural change; the need to be flexible in the implementation of the transformation models; and to rely on a guiding theoretical and conceptual framework to examine engagement for faculty and students.
Producing an Institutional Culture Change Requires a Concerted Effort
A program of this scope and breath requires a concerted effort from key partners at the institution. Engaging faculty from all 10 colleges at Purdue, in addition to the Honors College and the Graduate School, in a voluntary faculty development program and reaching thousands of students in the process, must be a campus-wide effort.
Every semester, up to 30 peer faculty and staff from the Center for Instructional Excellence (CIE), Teaching and Learning Technology (TLT), and the University Libraries collaborate to form the support team and work closely with faculty fellows and facilitate the FLC as part of the IMPACT program. The IMPACT program curriculum is enacted through 13 week Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs) and contains five components organized by leading questions for faculty fellows to consider in the redesign of their course:
1. Where are your students starting from and how do you motivate them to learn? 2. What do you want to accomplish, what do you want your students to be able to do, know, and appreciate at the end of the course? 3. How will you measure whether the students have achieved the desired skills, knowledge, and/or engagement? 4. How do you want to approach the redesign and the attainment of your course goals and student learning outcomes? 5. What methods and activities will you use to accomplish the redesign and assess the effectiveness of the transformation?
In addition to partnering with campus units who lead the faculty learning community and directly support the faculty, committed staff from the OIRAE and the ELRC facilitate monitoring and evaluation activities for IMPACT. Their activities include comprehensive data collection, analysis, and reporting. The partner units also collaborate on research studies examining faculty development, institutional cultural change, and student learning. Additional ongoing scholarship of teaching and learning conducted in partnership with IMPACT faculty contributes to a greater use of empiricallyderived effective learning and teaching practices institution wide.
The IMPACT program is fully supported by the President's and Provost's Office. In addition, support from central administration facilitated the construction of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center (WALC), a 90,000 square foot building home to the Library of Engineering & Science and 26 active learning classrooms. The construction of the WALC significantly contributed to the ability of faculty from all colleges to successfully implement their transformations. Active learning spaces that are housed within academic unit building are often specialized for the particular discipline and available primarily to faculty from that discipline within

However, the WALC provides six variations of active learning space designs, with different enrollment capacities, for faculty across disciplines seeking to incorporate active learning strategies in their courses.
Flexibility in the Implementation of IMPACT
The IMPACT program recognizes that the needs of faculty and students in each course may differ. Every transformation is tailored to the needs of the faculty member, students, and the course. For example, a number of transformations focused on changing the course model, ""flipping"" the course, so that students engage with lecture materials outside of class and do homework or other class exercises during class time (Fedesco & Troy, 2016;Simpson & Richards, 2015;Yough, Herron, Richards, & Ware, 2015). Other transformations focused on providing multiple options to students that include augmented, traditional, flipped, and fully online (Gundlach, Richards, Nelson, & Levesque-Bristol, 2015).
In other instances, faculty members focused on specific learning activities, such as making public speaking assignments more relevant to students' majors (Fedesco, Kentner & Natt, 2017), using social media to allow students to practice assessing statistical information from the news (Gundlach, Maybee, & O'Shea, 2015), applying peer-review as a formative learning tool on design teams (Mentzer, Laux, Zissimopoulos, & Richards, 2016), or developing effective writing exercises for engineering students (Essig, Troy, Jesiek, Boyd, & Trellinger, 2014).
In implementing these course transformations, IMPACT faculty tend to loosely follow one of three redesign models-supplemental, replacement, and fully online. The supplemental model and the replacement model are approximately equally used by faculty, with only a small proportion of faculty opting for the fully online model.
In the Replacement Model, which includes the hybrid and flipped modalities, IMPACT faculty typically create video lectures or interactive activities that the students watch or complete before coming to class. Class time is then mostly used for working through problems and collaborative learning. For example, in an introductory statistics course, students watch brief videos before class that were created to provide the information previously conveyed through classroom lectures. In class, the instructor provides a ten to fifteen minute presentation to remind students of the key points, after which the students work in groups to complete exercises applying statistical concepts outlined in the videos. Sometimes in the Replacement Model some face-to-face class time can be eliminated and replaced by out-of-class, online, and interactive learning activities.
The Supplemental Model typically retains the classroom lecture. Faculty choose this model for a variety of reasons, but in part because of a level of comfort and familiarity with this type of pedagogy. However, through the redesign process, the lectures are made to be much more active and engaging, with activities such as ""think-pair-share,"" the use of group discussions, or integration of technology. For example, Hotseat is a Purdue-made student response system, which allows students to complete polls, post questions, respond to comments, and answer questions in real time in large classrooms. In the supplemental model, technologybased, online, or structured out-of-class activities support lectures and textbook readings. Internal data suggests that the transformation model faculty chooses is less important than faculty comfort in the model they choose-so all modalities are valid and can be used with high level of success.
The Online Model moves most of the instruction and activities to the online environment. Some online courses require one face-to-face meeting at the beginning of the semester, but everything else is conducted online, in a mix of synchronous and asynchronous activities. Very few transformed courses adopt the fully online model.
Theoretical Framework Guiding Faculty Development and Course Redesign
In order to successfully and effectively engage faculty from all colleges in a faculty development program, it is crucially important to take into account the faculty perspective. Faculty need to feel agency in the faculty development process and an integral part of the transformation. For broad faculty development to work, and for institutional transformation to occur, faculty must feel heard. We argue that it is because we applied the principles of a broad theory of human motivation to faculty development that the IMPACT program has been successfully endorsed by faculty in all colleges at Purdue University.
Self-determination theory (SDT) is a humanistic theory of motivation, which has been empirically supported across different life domains and cultural contexts for over four decades. A cornerstone of self-determination theory is that all individuals have three basic psychological needs-autonomy, competence, and relatedness. When these are met there are many beneficial outcomes, in this case both personal and
The IMPACT program recognizes that the needs of faculty and students in each course may differ. Every transformation is tailored to the needs of the faculty member, students, and the course.
academic. Satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs foster optimal growth, development, and learning.
Autonomy, in the context of SDT, does not mean independence but rather feelings of volition and choice. For example, faculty and students tend to feel autonomous when they are given choices and options about how to perform or present their work. Redesigns which contribute to the satisfaction of the students' needs for autonomy focus on providing choices and options for students. In instances where choices are not possible, providing a rationale for tasks that are necessary but perhaps less interesting or not perceived as inherently valuable, contributes to the satisfaction of the need for autonomy. Faculty who integrate greater levels of autonomy in their courses pay attention to the students' perspective.
Competence has been the focus of multiple higher education studies, and represents the extent to which students believe they have mastered content material or are able to perform academically (Deci, Koestner, & Ryan, 1999;Deci & Ryan, 2000). The need for competence is satisfied when opportunities to demonstrate one's skills are provided on a regular basis and in a that allows students to receive feedback, improve their performance, and try again. In this context, scaffolding of learning experiences is very important.
Relatedness can be fostered when faculty and students feel connected, intellectually and emotionally, to other students in the class, as well as to their instructor. The need for relatedness is met when faculty and students are provided opportunities to interact and learn from one another, as well as opportunities to interact with the instructor in a meaningful way. This does not mean that students need to develop a close relationship with everyone in the class, including the instructor, but it does mean that students need to feel they can trust the instructor to help them achieve their academic goals in a mutually beneficial partnership. In addition, connection to the material presented in class, relevance, is important to foster perceived relatedness.
In IMPACT, the FLC support team strives to support the faculty's basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The faculty's expertise is recognized and fostered in the redesign process, and faculty are instrumental in guiding the goals of the redesign. Although the principles of SDT can easily be applied to teaching and professional development, little work has been conducted in this area (Deci, Kasser, & Ryan, 1997).
There is no ""one-size fits all"" model or formula for faculty. IMPACT is a high touch program in which faculty receive individualized attention, and the work of each support team member is extremely important. The faculty are at the center of the transformation process and through the professional development program are guided and aided by the support team. Although the members of the support team are highly knowledgeable and qualified in pedagogical innovations and best practices, they are trained to consult with faculty, rather than provide them answers, or push certain solutions or technologies.
Most of the studies examining the relevance of teaching and professional development from a self-determination perspective come from K-12 teachers. Teachers who are autonomously motivated for teaching were more likely to participate in training, report engagement with their teaching, implement innovative teaching strategies, and adopt more student-centered approaches (Gorozidis & Papaioannou, 2014;Klassen, Perry, & Frenzel, 2012;Korthagen & Evelein, 2016;Reeve, 1998Reeve, , 2002)).
A notable exception that does focus on higher education is the recent work of Stupnisky, Brckalorenz, Yuhas, & Guay (2018), which demonstrate that university faculty whose needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are met, report more autonomous motivation for teaching. These in turn predict the implementation of effective teaching strategies, including higher order learning, collaborative learning, and integrative learning.
Surveys of faculty and students suggest many positive outcomes of the SDT-based approach. Faculty interviews and focus groups show that faculty view IMPACT as a valuable source of professional development that positively impacts both their own teaching practice and student outcomes. Based on pre-participation and post-implementation surveys, IMPACT fellows report significant increases in both student engagement and critical thinking, as well as their own satisfaction with teaching after implementing their transformed course. They also report significant improvement in their pedagogical practices and experiences with classroom learning spaces after implementing their IMPACT course (IMPACT Management Team & IMPACT Assessment Team, 2017).
These results are matched in student surveys. In evaluating the effectiveness of IMPACT, we examine the extent A cornerstone of selfdetermination theory is that all individuals have three basic psychological needsautonomy, competence, and relatedness. When these are met there are many beneficial outcomes, in this case both personal and academic.
to which the redesigns create for students a learning environment consistent with the SDT framework. We believe that active learning strategies are effective as long as they contribute to the creation of a student-centered (autonomysupportive) environment by fostering the fulfillment of basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Fulfillment of these needs increases student motivation, which can then lead to student success, learning, retention, and ultimately progress toward degree completion.
In our review of the student perceptions data for students registered in the 292 IMPACT courses surveyed in at least one semester, the data indicate that we have been successful at creating learning environments that are student-centered. Over 80 percent of the courses taught by faculty who have gone through the IMPACT program are perceived to be student-centered. When we compare students exposed to highly student-centered classroom environments versus students exposed to non-student-centered environments, we find important differences in outcomes such as perceived competence, self-determined motivation, perceived knowledge transfer, and perceived learning gains (IMPACT Management Team & IMPACT Assessment Team, 2017).
Students exposed to highly student-centered classrooms developed in IMPACT report significantly higher levels of perceived competence, ability to transfer knowledge to other relevant courses and experiences, higher learning gains, and more self-determined types of motivation such as identification. The satisfaction of the basic psychological needs of autonomy and relatedness is associated with the development of perceived competence. This in turn is associated with greater levels of motivation and learning outcomes including academic performance, especially for students with lower levels of academic achievement .
Teaching People
Addressing the challenges facing higher education and supporting the success of students requires refocusing institutional culture to value and prioritize teaching efforts. This kind of shift will forge an environment that encourages the adoption of student-centered pedagogical strategies that advance learning.
IMPACT provides an example of a large-scale effort sustained over several years to systematically improve the quality and culture of undergraduate education. The insights gleaned from IMPACT suggest that the key component of a successful redesign lies in the ability of faculty to create learning environments that are student-centered and foster student autonomy and engagement. Supporting professional development aimed for faculty to integrate pedagogical tools, including technology, to engage students will foster student success and retention. Fostering student engagement and success is about empowering faculty, as suggested by self-determination theory, to create engaging and autonomysupportive learning environments.
As faculty we don't simply teach our discipline; we teach people about our discipline. Therefore, it is imperative that when working on course transformations and culture change, the human factor and motivation for teaching and learning is considered, fostered and nurtured.

Motivation is a phenomenon which affects the nature of an individual's behavior, the strength of the behavior, and the persistence of the behavior (Rani and Lenka) 2012. Motivation is internal and external factors that stimulate desire and energy in people to be continually interested in and committed to a job, role, or subject, and to exert persistent effort in attaining a goal (Onyeukwu and Ekere) 2018.\nIn university libraries, university librarians are faced with the problem of how to motivate library personnel. Kolawole, Abolaji and Olagoke (2015) defined motivation as an incentive given by the employer to employees to enable them perform their jobs creditably, while Strough, Bruine de Bruin and Peters (2015) referred to motivation as the willingness to engage with a decision, including considering the presented information, deliberating about the options, and selecting the option that is most likely to lead to preferred outcomes.\nThe concept of the effect of motivation in the university libraries is of prime importance. This is simply because achieving socio-economic development and making impact in the learning ability of the students within the country cannot be overlooked (Ugah, 2008).\nThe type and quality of motivation given to library personnel, affect their job performance positively or negatively ( Idiegbeyan-Ose and Idahosa, 2011). The greatest asset of any university library whether federal government, state government or private owned is the human capital .This is so because the functionality of other aspect of the resources, finance and material, depends on the human capital (Szalma,2014).\nEffective library personnel motivation has long been one of university's librarian most difficult and important duty (Iwu, 2011) . Success in this endeavor is becoming more challenging in the light of pressure to increase productivity and effective service delivery (Salaam Alawiye and Okunlaya, 2013).\nUniversity libraries can easily achieve its objectives when the library personnel are effectively motivated. When motivation is not done in a library, it might be difficult to achieve the stated objectives of the university (Odeku and Odeku, 2014).\nNo University library can be higher in quality than the level of motivation and job performance of the personnel within the system (Tella and Popoola.2007). In terms of job context, job content and reward system for library personnel, there is a kind of systematic motivation inadequacy within the Nigerian university library system (Obajemu Dekpen, .and Ojo 2012). Reward systems in terms of salaries and emoluments appear unsatisfactory. Improvements in recent years are not deep enough to record satisfactory improvement in library personnel morale (Odunlade, 2012).\nAccording to Safiullah, (2015) motivation is an index of inner feeling in a certain way to the need of the individual that jobs must be designed to further employee's performance and fulfillment. Fajana (2002) added that motivation is of two kinds namely, positive motivation and negative motivation.\nâ€¢\nPositive Motivation is seen when people behave according to what is expected by the society.\nâ€¢ Negative Motivation is doing wrong things which are kicked against by the society.\nIn addition, there are motivating factors that will lead to library personnel' satisfaction and increased motivation. Examples are achievement, recognition, advancement and work it.\nThe success of any university library depends on the effectiveness of employee's job performance which to a large extent depends on the level of skill acquisition, experience and motivation among other factors.\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nThe most difficult problem faced by most university librarians is the impact of Motivation and job performance as a tool to enhance library personnel effectiveness in discharge of their duties (Gagne, 2014). Therefore, this research examined the concept of motivation as a tool for job satisfaction in library personnel for effectiveness on their jobs.\nOBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n1. To determine the effect of motivation on library personnel effectiveness in Universities Libraries in Nigeria.\n2. To ascertain the available structures for staff motivation.\n3. To find out the effect of job satisfaction on library personnel effectiveness in University Libraries in Nigeria.\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nPeople will like to work effectively and efficiently if well-motivated. The private and public university libraries can use the research findings and recommendations made to improve in their style of management and effectively motivate library personnel towards better job performance and service delivery. The data collected and recommendations would serve as reference material to students and the academic community as a basis for further academic research. It will also serve as a guide to federal government, state government and private university libraries in the formulation of human capital policies.\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThe scope of study centered on motivational tools in university libraries in Nigeria, using University of Benin library, Benin, Ambrose Alli University Library, Ekpoma and Samuel Adegboyega University library, Ogwa.\nRESEARCH QUESTIONS\nâ€¢ What are the effects of motivation on library personnel effectiveness university libraries in Nigeria?\nâ€¢ Do available structures have effect on staff motivation?\nâ€¢ What are the effects of job satisfaction on library personnel effectiveness?\nHYPOTHESIS\nThe following are the hypothesis formulated for the purpose of this study.\nH0 -Motivation enhances library personnel effectiveness.\nH1 -Motivation does not enhance library personnel effectiveness H0 -Job satisfaction leads to improved library personnel job performance.\nH2 -Job satisfaction does not lead to library personnel job performance\nLITERATURE REVIEW THE CONCEPT OF MOTIVATION\nBamgbose and Ladipo (2017) asserted that motivation is a process by which the learner's internal energies are directed toward various goals or objects. He noted that motivation is an internal condition that activates behavior and gives it direction and energies and directs goal-oriented behavior. Similarly the various theories of motivation may be rooted in the basic need to minimize physical pain and maximize pleasure. Ola and Adeyemi, (2012) described motivation as the complex forces, incentives, needs, tensions and other mechanisms which energize, canalize and sustain human behavior to carry out a particular action. In effect, motivation refers to the degree of energy and commitment with which a person performs a job. Kolajo (2012) asserted that motivation is a process of goal-setting which establishes standard of performance that relate to self-efficacy and out-come expectations, Motivation is divided into two parts; intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. Ledford, Gerhart and Fang (2013) defined intrinsic motivation as that which arises from performing the task. An employee may feel motivated to perform the task because doing so gives that worker a feeling of accomplishment, mastery and self-fulfillment (Hassan and Romle, 2015).\nExtrinsic motivation, on the other hand, comes from outside the individual, and results from the expectation of receiving external rewards such as salary, benefits, incentives, promotions and recognition in exchange for job performance. When personnel are intrinsically motivated, they do not need extensive extrinsic incentives because working in itself is rewarding declared Georgellis and Tabvuma (2011). Banuri and Keefer (2013) supporting the above assertion stated that personnel find the working environment enjoyable and task participation rewarding.\nThe positive effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation, and by demonstrating that the rewards-creativity relationship varies across employees depending on their individual differences (Mallaiah and Yadapadithaya, 2009). Thus, they may decide to undertake a task for its own sake, for the satisfaction it provides of accomplishment or self-actualization. Ryan and Deci (2000) opined that extrinsic motivation refers to the offering of incentives for successful task performance. In fact, extrinsically motivated staff is those who are not really interested in the activity for its own sake, but care only about the rewards that the work will bring them (Lai, 2001).\nAn extrinsically motivated staff may follow the working profession in order to obtain some reward such as increased salary, promotion or praise. Although extrinsic motivations can have immediate and powerful effects, they do not necessarily last long. Library personnel need to be intrinsically motivated to be professionally committed and motivated.\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MOTIVATION, JOB SATISFACTION AND PERSONNEL\n\nEFFECTIVENESS\nThe relationship between motivation, job satisfaction and effectiveness is very important in the library. Research has found that the single greatest predictor of longevity is work satisfaction (Kaiser, 2014). Work is one third to one half of a person's lifetime, and if frustrated the mental and physical effects are very costly (Nwosu, Ugwoegbu and Okeke, 2013). Iyida (2015) declared that monetary incentive further improved personnel job performance but added no incremental satisfaction gain. The incorporation of production standards, performance feedback and monetary incentive affected job satisfaction and productivity differently and this had an effect on the personnel's satisfaction. (Malik, Butt and Choi, 2015). A more important area of concern for management arising out of the review include the psychological effects of job content, the matching of jobs to individual needs, the appropriateness of reward systems, and the use of performance appraisal and salary evaluation. All are seen as being pertinent to the quality of organizational functioning (Shuck, Zigarmi and Owens, 2015). It is therefore contended that a holistic contingency approach which takes into account the needs of workers, the characteristics of their work environment and the requirements of the organization should be adopted.\nMayo (1932) undertook one of the first modern studies of work behavior as it relates to productivity. Mayo's experiment actually demonstrated the relationship between motivation, job satisfaction and productivity. The results became known as the Hawthorne Effect.\nThe significant point here is that human beings react to other human beings. Your personnel, be it two or two hundred, will react to you. The interest you take and the attention you pay to them will have more to do with their level of motivation than anything else. Level of motivation has more to do with personnel satisfaction and the level of effective job performance than anything else.\nUnderstanding your personnel, what makes them 'turn on' or 'turn off' to the work process is a key to your being able to get things done through them. In a nutshell, there is a strong relationship between motivation, job satisfaction and personnel effectiveness (Kolawole, Abolaji and Olagoke\n2015)\n.\nWAGES AND SALARIES AS MOTIVATIONAL TOOLS\nIgbaekemem (2015) noted that the main element justifying the use of wages and salaries to encourage personnel involvement in organizational task are as follows:\nâ€¢ They provide significant economic advantages for individuals and organizations particularly where the participation of personnel are required for the achievement of organizational goals.\nâ€¢ Depending on how wages and salaries are applied, a whole series of important objectives can be achieved; stimulating production through higher incentives, compensating for heavy work load on workers, ensuring workers receive their wage and salary as at when due an remunerating personnel who have contributed immensely to the growth and development of the organization.\nâ€¢ Wages and salaries provide a policy tool for overcoming the major constraints to personnel's involvement in organizational plans and projects.\nSuch constraints include lack of awareness of the employees' contribution to the company, lack of interest to work due to limited wages and salaries, lack of financial and technical capacity and shortcomings in service and marketing infrastructures.\nâ€¢ Wages and salaries are clearly worthwhile since they can stimulate staff involvement in organizational task at a lower economic cost.\nWages and salaries are only used as temporary policies bridging the gap between destitution and relative prosperity. Similarly, wages and salaries cannot be used as a yardstick for measuring the amount of effort contributed by personnel to organizational task because some personnel work\nmore and yet are underpaid asserted Adams and Hicks (2000).\nGregerson (1998) opined that wages are payment received by an employee in exchange for labor.\nIt may be in goods or services but is customarily in money. Similarly, in a broad sense it refers to what is received in any way for labor, but wages usually refer to payments to workers who are paid by the hour, in contrast to a salary, which implies a more fixed and permanent form of income. In economic theory (Flinta, 2003) enumerated that, wages reckoned in money are called nominal wages, as distinguished from real wages. Real wages depend on the price level, as well as on the nominal or money wages (Bochet, 2003) noted that for many people, the use of the term salary has to do with the reception of any type of regular payments from an employer to an employee. While this is close to the mark, it is not quite true.\nMOTIVATION AS A TOOL FOR ACHIEVING PERSONNEL EFFECTIVENESS\nMcGregor (1966) opined that the first group of workers can be classified under theory where the average man likes and enjoys work, not only exercises self-control and self-direction but also uses his imaginations ingenuity, and creativity in solving organization problems The second group of workers, Macgregor said, can be classified under 'X' theory where man does not like work, but works, because work provides for him means of livelihood and is forced to work well only when basic needs are threatened.\nIt is generally agreed that in order to increase efficiency and effectiveness, personnel's needs must be met. In order to succeed, the management need to identify those needs that can easily motivate its personnel before applying them. Dartey-Baahto and Amoako (2011) referred to Herzberg ; some items such as work itself, responsibility, growth, achievement, advancement, recognition are regarded as motivational factors while some others are classified as dissatisfies (hygiene factors).\nThey include interpersonal relations, supervision, company policy, and salary and job security.\nAnother important way to motivate personnel is to mount an adequate training and retraining scheme. In this age of technological advancement, workers need to update themselves from time to time in order to acquaint themselves with the changes that are taking place, therefore, long and short-term training programmes are required for personnel if they are to be efficient and effective.\nThe effectiveness of work can be attained when the needs of the personnel are met. 'Work' to some people has intrinsic value, but to others it is a derived means. If all people believed in intrinsic value of work then less effort would have to be devoted to motivation.\nDATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS\nTo analyze the data in relationship to the research questions all the responses on the items addressing the research questions were collated and presented in the frequency tables, after which simple percentage was used to analyze the data.\nAll the hypotheses postulated were tested at 0.05 levels of significance using the Chi-squared test. The number of questionnaires administered to the workers was 120 and after completion, 109 questionnaires were returned while 11 were not answered. This therefore implies that the return rate was 90.83 percent. From the table 2 above, the distribution showed that out of the 109 responses received, a greater proportion i.e. 62 subjects or 56.88 percent respondents are male; while 47 subjects (or 48.12 percent) respondents are female respondents. This number did not in any way affect the degree of response on the variables raised in the research study as the judgment or choice of responses are not gender specific. From the study, it is observed that the distribution in table 5 shows that the highest response was received from workers that have 6-10 years' experience; this number represented 46 (42.2%) workers this was followed by 35 workers or 32.11 percent respondents who have 11-15 years of experience. However 18 workers or 16.52% respondents and 10 workers or 9.17 percent respondents respectively have above 15 years and 1-5 years of work experience. These results\nAnalysis of demographic data\nshow that the information received from the respondents to a fair degree should be representative of the views of the respondents \nTEST OF HYPOTHESIS\n\nDISCUSSION AND INTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS\nThe first Null hypothesis which stated that Motivation do not enhance library personnel effectiveness rejected. This therefore implies that the alternative hypothesis which states that Motivation enhances library personnel effectiveness. According to the rule when X2 calculated is greater than X2 tab, then reject Ho and accept Hi and vice-versa. Studies have shown that there are some motivators that provide real motivation and when they are inadequate, library personnel are not motivated (Senyah, 2003). (Abifarin, 1997) lent a support to this, that University Librarians should adopt reward, internship training, transformational and facilitative leadership to ensure that the management goals are achieved because the working task has been made more interesting, meaningful and challenging.\nThe second Null Hypothesis which states that job satisfaction does not lead to improved library personnel job performance is rejected while the alternative hypothesis which states that job satisfaction leads to improved employee job performance is accepted. The findings of Akintayo (2007) supported this finding in which he said that personnel would be motivated only to the extent that they expect high levels of efforts resulting to high levels of monetization of compensation. If personnel do not believe that their performance will be rewarded then there is no way they can achieve job satisfaction and this will affect motivation negatively, but if they believe in the high valence of outcomes they will be highly motivated to work towards attaining job satisfaction.\nSUMMARY OF FINDINGS\nBased on the information from the findings, it is generally accepted that financial benefits has a very positive effect on the motivation of library personnel.\nAlso, it was gathered that there is a real motivation when University Librarians adopt reward, internship training, and facilitative leadership to ensure that the management's goals are achieved so as to make work interesting and meaningful.\nConclusively, it should be noted that library personnel will be motivated only to the extent that they expect high level of efforts reflected in their level of performance are followed by an equal valence of compensation. As a result of this, it tends to help them to attain job satisfaction by being highly motivated.\nRECOMMENDATION\nHaving outlined the summary of the research findings, the researcher has identified some lapses that have impeded the workers efforts toward motivating library personnel and so decided to make these following recommendations.\nâ€¢ University Librarians should employ motivational tools for library personnel effectiveness in discharge of their duties.\nâ€¢ Appropriate reward packages should be put in place as for outstanding library personnel.\nâ€¢ Job satisfaction of library personnel should be imperative by University Librarians.\nCONCLUSION\nOf all the job of university librarians, managing the human component is the central and most important task because everything depends on how well it is done. According to Das (2015), the principal objective of management should be the promotion of the maximum prosperity of each personnel with the hope of realizing the maximum job performance effectiveness.\nAccepting motivation is necessary in order to encourage positive change. Motivation depends very much on the action of the library management. The primary function of management is to ensure that personnel achieve organizational goals.\nIn the light of this, there are many ways university librarians should consider motivating workers.\nMoney is very important. When the employee receives low wages, an increase in money would greatly increase the workers morale.",4030,4556

This paper investigated the relationship between staff development and job performance of the library staff of five selected universities in Ghana. The paper examined the effectiveness of staff training and development policies, programmes, methods, training needs analysis and the monitoring and evaluation methods of the university libraries in order to establish the effectiveness of staff development initiatives in library and information services. The study adopted survey design and mixed methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative approaches in a single study. Data was largely collected with a questionnaire, while interviews were used to collect data from head librarians and heads of departments. The observation instrument was also used to confirm some information provided by the respondents. The findings of the study established that there is a positive relationship between staff training and development and work performance of library staff in the selected university libraries in Ghana. The results also revealed that even though staff development contributes greatly to effective provision of library and information services, staff training alone did not contribute to staff effectiveness. Staff development must be complemented with other human resource management strategies such as reward, promotion, retooling, etc. The paper makes recommendations on how staff development can help improve upon library staff effectiveness.
",2016-08-18,Information Development,SAGE Publications,"Introduction
The constantly evolving technological and organizational changes in libraries have dramatically increased the scope of librarians' responsibilities. Libraries must therefore make a commitment to answer the need for skills and expanded services with staff development and continuing education (Callahan and Watson 1995: 380). Staff training and development in libraries is therefore intended to strengthen the capabilities of the library to perform its mission more effectively and efficiently in an increasing information technology era. Staff training and development programmes in libraries will also affirm the ability of the individual and the libraries to grow and for each to contribute to the growth of the other (Jurrow 1992: 5). University libraries therefore require librarians in all areas to possess a greater variety of skills to utilize modern information and communication technologies to expand services and provide adequate resources for the university community. Staff training and development in university libraries is of the utmost importance as it helps to build the capacity of library staff to cope with the current technological and organizational changes taking place in university libraries. University library administrators therefore have to recognize that before library staff can contribute effectively to the fulfilment of the library's mandate and strategic objectives, staff should be given opportunities to develop their skills, knowledge and abilities through training and development programmes.
According to Lamptey and Agyen-Gyasi (2010: 20) academic libraries in Ghana will in future need a team of flexible experts with a variety of aptitudes and specialization who will collaborate as researchers, managers and technologists. They also have to be proactive to help in the fulfilment of the mission of their respective universities. This will make university libraries in Ghana different from what we know. University libraries in Ghana have therefore instituted several staff training and development programmes with the goal of developing the capacity of library staff to perform their functions effectively and efficiently for higher productivity.
The staff training and development programmes that have been instituted in the university libraries in Ghana generally include orientation programmes, on-the-job-training, opportunity to attend workshops/ seminars/conferences, opportunity to prepare for advancement activities, research and publications, membership of library associations and networks, study leaves, assignments, job rotation (Adanu 2007;Alemna, 2001;Asiagodo, 1989;Lamptey and Agyen-Gyasi, 2010). However, the extent to which these training and development programmes contribute to the provision of effective library and information services in the university libraries in Ghana is not known. It is against this background therefore that the need for this study was envisaged.
Statement of the problem
University libraries are changing in response to changes in the learning and research environment. New technologies are also changing the services that libraries provide, for example, online reference and instruction, desktop document delivery and automated self-service systems. Staff training and development programmes have therefore been instituted to help keep library staff up-to-date with these new developments in the field of librarianship.
Despite the recognized importance of staff training and development programmes, a search of the literature revealed that these libraries have not effectively utilized the full potential of staff training and development programmes; neither have they received the full benefits of training and development because most of these programmes are not evaluated to ascertain the extent to which they contribute to improved work performance. As a result, the university libraries are still struggling to design and implement automation projects; there is poor delivery of library services; there is lack of knowledge on current best practices; poor collection management; and the majority of library users are still not information literate. This article will examine the relationship between staff training and development programmes and the work performance of library staff in the provision of effective library and information services in the university libraries in Ghana.
Research objectives
This article focuses on the following objectives; to: examine the effectiveness of staff training and development policies and programmes, instituted in the university libraries in Ghana establish how staff training and development programmes have affected both individual library staff and institutional performance in the provision of library and information services in the university libraries in Ghana establish if there is any relationship between staff training and development programmes and work performance of library staff identify the deficiencies and challenges in the implementation of staff training and development policies and programmes make recommendations on how to improve upon staff training and development and its contribution to work performance of library staff.
Research hypotheses
The hypotheses that guided this study are:
There is a positive relationship between staff training and development and work performance of library staff of the university libraries in Ghana.
Staff training and development programmes will affect the work performance of both individual library staff and the institution in the provision of library and information services.
Literature review Rama and Nagurvali (2012: 722)  Training is said to be effective when the training outcomes match with their objectives. Training programmes should therefore be designed and delivered to meet the needs of both the employees and the organization. The employees should be able to apply what they learned on the job and this should reflect in reduced cost of production, saved time, improved services, increased customer satisfaction, improved morale, decreased grievances or complaints and improved capabilities to meet future demands and higher productivity. The way to know if there was an improvement is to have these variables, that is, time, service, morale, capability before training and after training, measured to determine if there was improvement (Hurque and Vyas 2008: 188-204;Kunche, Kumar, Guniganti et al., 2011: 1-3). Asare-Bediako (2008: 179) suggests that training transfer could be facilitated through collaborative efforts involving three parties, namely, trainee, trainer and supervisor, and that each of them needs to take some action before, during and after the training programme. It is, however, difficult to measure training effectiveness, because training results may not be immediately reflected in the job performance of the trainee. What is even more difficult is the measurement of training results in monetary terms. Creg and Bradley (2000: 212) explain that while many attempts have been made to measure the results of training in financial terms, the complexity of organizations and the myriad variables involved often frustrate such attempts. There is also extreme difficulty in isolating the effectiveness of training in reference to job performance.
Training programmes are, therefore, effective only to the extent that the skills and behaviour learned can actually be transferred to the job. It is also important to emphasize that training efforts have the most lasting beneficial effects when staff are engaged in the discussion about the training right from the planning stage. In this way training is likely to impact positively on job performance.
It can also be argued that the provision of staff training and development opportunities alone cannot lead to effectiveness and higher productivity. There are many other factors that contribute to job performance, effectiveness and productivity. Effective job performance requires an environment that enables employees to apply knowledge, skills and abilities in ways that support the mission and goals of the organization. Dawo, Simatwa-Enose and Okwatch (2012: 316), in a study to evaluate the effects of staff development practices on job performance in some selected universities in Kenya, established that staff development practices alone did not contribute significantly to job performance. The authors suggested that staff development practices were supported with other human resource management/development strategies such as reward, promotion, salary increase, and other motivation strategies to engineer staff interest for improved job performance. In a similar study conducted by Osei (1996: 31-36), at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Ghana, the author argued that staff development flourishes in an atmosphere where professionals are adequately and sufficiently motivated. A situation where staff development fails to motivate staff, because of the inability of the organization to provide resources and materials which the professionals need to do their work, invariably leads to frustration. For instance, a person who returns from a course anxious to practice a new technique or skills will quickly lose enthusiasm if his/her efforts are met with hostility or indifference. The use of the right approach to motivate library staff will, no doubt, enable university libraries to accomplish their goals and objectives of providing the required information to support teaching, learning, research and knowledge dissemination (Lamptey, Boateng and Antwi, 2013: 4).
Several authors in the reviewed literature (Abba and Dawha, 2009;Baldwin, Gibbs and Slough, 1997;Broady-Preston, 2009;Fritts and Casey, 2010;Kisby and Holler, 2009;Mackenzie and Smith, 2012;Paster, 2004;Snyder and Sanders, 1978;Weaver, Holland and Tonner, 2009) have, however, established that effective staff training and development programmes have contributed to improved job performance and higher productivity. Onyia and Aniogbolu (2011: 103-113) carried out a study on the effects of training and retraining of library workers on their job performance at Delta State Polytechnic Library, Nigeria. The findings showed that staff training and development provided by the organization had contributed to a large extent to staff performance on the job. A planned staff development process helps to equip library staff with new technological skills needed to enhance their job performance and prevent skills obsolescence. Staff training and development programmes should be evaluated to determine the cost effectiveness of training programmes. This will give room for the introduction of new techniques, provide for succession, enable qualified placement and raise the standard of unskilled personnel. Akintunde ( 2004) also supports the argument that staff training and development initiatives contribute enormously to the job performance of library workers.
The results of studies by several authors (Abba and Dawha, 2009: 1-8;Dasgupta and Satpathi, 2006: 239-246;Harvey and Sayers, 2009: 205;Martell and Dougherty, 1978: 153-159) have established that continuous educational programmes enable employees to acquire the knowledge that helps them to cope with the tasks of providing better information services to support teaching and learning. The findings of these studies showed that continuing education was helping library staff to build and update previously acquired knowledge, skills and attributes and this was contributing to better job performance, job satisfaction, decrease in turnover and further job advancement.
Some studies (Adanu, 2007;Alemna, 2001: 44-47, Asiagodo, 1999;Effah, 1998;Lamptey and Agyen-Gyasi, 2010;Pan and Hovde, 2010: 2-4) are closely related to this study. According to Adanu (2007: 1-5) the majority of librarians working in the state-owned university libraries in Ghana are aware of continuous professional development programmes. However, they have not taken advantage of these programmes because there are financial constraints in funding such programmes in the libraries. Lamptey and Agyen-Gyasi (2010: 1-5) suggest the need to train future librarians in academic libraries in Ghana to meet future job requirements. Some studies (Armstrong, 2000;Cole, 2000;Eze, 2012;Yadapadithaya and Stewart, 2003) have indicated that staff training and development programmes are not without challenges.
Other studies (Benn and Moore, 2009;Brewsaugh and Valleroy, 2011;Elaine, 2006;Golden, 2006;Harvey and Sayers, 2009;Kalin, 2010;Thorton, 2010) are also relevant to the current study. These studies provide the career development directions for future librarians and the skills needed by the next generation of librarians to enable them perform their duties efficiently. Varlejs (1987) recommends a broad range of training and development activities for librarians. These include on-the-job-training, orientation, in-service workshops, guest lectures, consultancy works, membership of committees and associations, job rotation, mentoring, research and publications. However, these studies did not establish how these training and development programmes/methods have affected staff work performance, especially in the provision of library and information services.
A similar study conducted by Osei (1996: 31-36) at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana, revealed that since 1951 staff development programmes benefited the KNUST library in the following ways: they enabled staff to cope with modern technologies, new trends and current development and they broadened and widened staff knowledge and experiences, thus making staff more skilful and effective in the performance of their jobs.
In summary, the reviewed literature revealed that staff training and development programmes contribute to the acquisition of new knowledge, skills, ability and change behaviour. These eventually affect job performance and productivity. Nevertheless, all these studies failed to establish the extent to which effective training and development contributes to effective library and information services in the university library environment.
This paper focuses on investigating the contribution of staff training and development programmes to university library staff and university library work performance, with the aim of establishing the relationships between staff training and development programmes and the work performance of library staff.
Research methodology
This study made use of a mixed methods approach, a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches. The mixed methods approach was applied in data collection, data analysis and interpretation of the findings of this study. This approach was deployed for triangular purposes as a means of seeking convergence across qualitative and quantitative approaches. The qualitative approach was used to collect and analyze data from the university librarians and some heads of department, while the quantitative approach was used to collect and analyze data from the faculty, library staff and students.
Data collection
Data was collected by means of structured and selfadministered questionnaires. Different sets of questionnaires were used for the various groups, namely library staff, faculty and students. Research assistants were hired to distribute the questionnaires and in some cases the questionnaires were mailed to the respondents. The respondents were given a maximum period of 10 days to complete and return the questionnaires. The research assistants went back to collect the completed questionnaires. The researchers monitored the distribution and return of completed questionnaires. After receiving the completed questionnaires, the researchers assigned a numerical code to each questionnaire.
The other way of data collection was by means of standardized structured interviews. The interviews for this study were conducted with five university librarians, and 10 selected heads of department/section from the five selected institutions. The questions for the university librarians focused on ascertaining information on the background of their respective libraries, the state of training and development policy and training needs analysis/assessment, staff training and development programmes, monitoring and evaluation of training programmes, the effects of training and development programmes on staff performance as well as the measurement of return on investment in training.
The researchers used obtrusive techniques to observe the library operations at the circulation desks, reference and electronic support service centres. They also observed the training programmes that were organized for library staff. The unobtrusive observation technique was used at the security check points to observe when staff reported and signed off from work. The turnaround time for serving library users and the time it took to perform assignments given to staff by their superiors were also observed and recorded. The staff appraisal forms and written reports of staff who participated in STDP and the monitoring and evaluation process to determine the effects of training and development on staff work performance were also observed. Most of the observed situations were recorded. Permission was, however, obtained from the heads of department/section before the observation.
Population
This study focused on the library staff at all levels, faculty and student communities of five selected university libraries in Ghana, namely, University of Ghana, Methodist University College Ghana, Central University College and University of Education Winneba and the University of Cape Coast. The five universities were carefully selected to represent both public and private universities in Ghana. As at the time of this study Ghana had 50 universities. A total of five (10%) universities were sampled because of logistics and other research constraints. The researchers considered all the various categories of library staff, namely, professional librarians and non-professional librarians as well as support staff (See Table 2.1 andTable 2.
2).
The first targeted population for this study was the library staff of the five selected university libraries. The total population of library staff in the libraries was 503. The selection of the five institutions took into consideration the need to have both public and private universities represented, their location or accessibility and the state of the university libraries, among others. The selection also took into consideration the composition of the library staff, which consisted of professional and paraprofessional librarians as well as administrative and IT staff. The second targeted population was the faculty of the five selected institutions. The total population of this group was 12,417 and the faculty group consisted of professors, associate professors, senior lecturers, lecturers, assistant lecturers, teaching assistants and research fellows.
The third targeted population was the students of the selected institutions, which consisted of both postgraduates and undergraduates. The total population in this group was 126,463. The faculty and student populations were selected because some aspects of this study focused on assessing the work performance of library staff. Faculty and students, being the major library users or beneficiaries of library and information services, are capable of assessing the work performance of library staff. The positive assessment of staff performance by faculty and students may suggest that STDP in these libraries had positive effects.
Sampling
The researchers made use of mixed sampling methods to sample the population for this study. For instance, the stratified random sampling technique was used to divide the population into three strata namely; library staff, faculty and student groups, while the systematic random sampling technique was used to select samples from the various strata. The purposive sampling framework was also used to select some key people from the various strata into the sampled population. According to Denscombe (1998: 12-13) stratified sampling gives every member of the population an equal chance of being selected to the proportion within the population. The advantages of these techniques are that they helped the researcher to maintain some control over the selection of the samples in order to guarantee that the crucial people were covered, and in the proportion that they exist in the wider population. The sample from the selected university libraries represented the larger population. Care was, however, taken to cover the different views and feelings of all categories of staff, for example, male and female, professional and non-professional, supervisors, as well as the management staff.
Sample size. The main factors that determined the sample size for this study were the desire for accuracy and the confidence level. The use of multiple methods research and triangulation were intended to enhance accuracy. The total population from which samples were taken for this study was 139,383. To achieve a confidence level of 95% and a confidence interval of 0.05, a sample size of about 384 was required. This produced a relative standard error of 5.10%. (Yamane, 1967: 886). Given that, in administering a survey, there could be a degree of non-returns, and to achieve the desired confidence level, the following strategy was adopted. The total sampling size of 860 was chosen based on the staff/student numbers and the composition of the population.
Considering the total population size of the selected universities, the researchers administered 240 questionnaires at each of the three state-owned universities, namely University of Ghana, University of Cape Coast and University of Education Winneba, and 110 questionnaires at each of the private universities, namely Methodist University College Ghana and Central University College. The questionnaire covered the three groups of the population, namely, faculty, students and library staff. The selection of the appropriate sample size helped the researchers to achieve the desired confidence level of the results.
Data analysis
The researchers made use of the services of a professional statistician and computer programmes such as SPSS (version 16) and Microsoft Excel. Measurable data was reported, coded and analyzed using computerized statistical packages. The completed questionnaires were analyzed to identify significant relationships between variables. The objective of the statistical analysis was to ascertain information about the relationships between staff training and development programmes and library staff work performance. This study used the t-test of statistical significance, ANOVA, Chi square and Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the contribution of staff training and development to work performance. Finally each research question and/or hypothesis was appropriately presented and/or analyzed with relevant test statistics or by the use of illustrations. Thematic content analysis technique was used to analyze the qualitative data. The sample size of the students group from the five institutions was 400, with the breakdown as follows: 100 each from the University of Ghana, University of Cape Coast, 80 from University of Education Winneba and 60 each from Methodist University College Ghana and Central University College. The selection was based on the total student numbers at the participating institutions.
Findings and discussion

Demographic information
Out of the 860 questionnaires that were distributed, 544 (63.3%) completed ones were returned. The percentage returns from all the five institutions were as follows: the lowest return of (18%) came from Central University College, followed by (19%) from both Methodist University College and University of Cape Coast, while the highest return (22%) came from the University of Ghana and University of Education Winneba.
The results in Table 1.2 indicate that faculty respondents represented 164 (30%) of the total sample. The researchers received almost an equal number of responses from faculty group respondents from each of the five institutions. The faculty from the University of Ghana and the Methodist University College Ghana constituted the majority of respondents in this category, with slightly more respondents than the rest, while the faculty from the University of Cape Coast were least in number. This may be attributed to the higher staff population at the University of Ghana.
Students represented 262 (48%) of the total sample, out of which those from the University of Education Winneba were the majority, while those from the University of Cape Coast were the least. Library staff comprised 118 (22%) of the total sample. Most of the library staff were from the University of Ghana, and the least from the Methodist University College Ghana. The higher student population can be attributed to the fact that the students make up the highest   sampled population. The researchers are of the view that students are an important user group of library services and their perceptions of the effectiveness of work performance of library staff are important. Table 2.1 shows that library staff respondents comprised 46 (39%) library assistants, 15 (13%) senior library assistants, 15 (13%) principal library assistants, 2 (2%) chief library assistants, 15 (13%) assistant librarians, 3 (3%) senior assistant librarians, 5 (4%) deputy librarians, 3 (3%) IT support staff, 13 (11%) administrative staff and 1 (1%) other staff. These results indicate that the study covered all the various categories of library staff in the selected universities.
Table 2.2 shows that 23 (19.5%) of the library staff respondents were professionals, consisting of Assistant Librarians, Senior Assistant Librarians and Deputy Librarians, while 78 (66.1%) were paraprofessionals, consisting of Library Assistants and Senior/ Principal/Chief Library Assistants, while 17 (14.4%) were Support staff, consisting of Information Technology and Administrative staff. These results indicate that the majority of the library staff respondents were paraprofessionals. These findings reflect the situation in Ghanaian university libraries, where the paraprofessionals dominate the library staff. The professionals usually are the heads of departments/sections/units and supervisors, and they constitute the middle and senior level management staff of the university libraries in Ghana.
Table 3 shows the academic qualifications of the library staff. The results indicate that all the various categories of library staff had the requisite qualifications in library and information science for their respective positions. The minimum academic qualification for a professional librarian is a masters or MPhil degree. This results shows that all the professional respondents had either Masters or MPhil degrees in library and information science.
The paraprofessionals, on the other hand, had the requisite qualification of an SHS/Diploma for Library Assistants and a BA/BSc degree for Senior/Principal/ Chief Library Assistants.
The interviews with the five university librarians confirmed that they all had a minimum of an MPhil degree in library and information science, and in some cases a second graduate degree in another subject area.
The use of staff training and development programmes
Both the quantitative and qualitative results indicate that several types of STDP were available at the various institutions. The STDP programmes that were available included: classroom training, consultant training, workshops/seminars/conferences, job rotation, long distance learning, professional associations, research and publications, study visits, case studies, mentoring/coaching,
The results further revealed that the STDP designed for the various categories of library staff across the institutions were as follows:
Professional staff: Job rotation, mentoring/ coaching, workshops/seminars/conferences, research and publications, professional association, case studies and study visits. Job rotation involves shifting library staff through a series of related library jobs. It is used mostly to get library staff acquainted with all sections of library work.
Coaching is mainly employed on a one-to-one basis. This helps library staff transfer theory learned into practice. Mentoring, like coaching, employs a one-to-one training strategy. It is used by a senior inside person to train managerial library staff.
Case studies give participants an avenue to apply theoretical concepts to an applied complex situation, thus bridging theory and practice. Case studies portray a complex problem as well as illustrating its main point. They help to build participants' communication, team work and problem solving skills.
Simulation and the use of games create an artificial environment which attempts to replicate a real life event in the everyday activities of library staff.
Workshops/seminars/conferences are the traditional and direct methods of instruction. They may involve verbal presentation to a large audience.
Classroom training provides instructor-led classes for library staff in a dynamic learning environment.
Consultant training involves engagement of a library consultant to provide training to library staff in specific areas.
Research/publications involve professional library staff who research and publish scholarly papers/books in their fields of specialization. Research and publications is a major requirement for promotion for senior staff members.
Professional associations, like networks, provide library staff with the opportunity to stay in touch with other colleagues. Professional associations also provide opportunities for continuous professional development.
Long distance learning involves library staff who undertake remote learning without regular face-toface contact with the teacher or the institution.
Table 4 shows the results on the extent of use of staff training and development programmes by library staff. The low levels of use of most types of STDP can be attributed to the high proportion of library assistant respondents, who usually were not the main target for continuous professional development programmes. The most used STDP was job rotation, with a total of 61 (51.7%) library staff using this programme between one and more than four times a year. This was followed by workshops/conferences/seminars with a total of 58 (49.1%) library staff also using this programme between one and more than four times a year. The least used programmes were case studies (11: 9.3%) and simulation/games (10: 8.5%). The interview results confirmed the quantitative data. The university librarians/heads of department as well as the observation results revealed that the STDP available to library staff of the participating institutions included classroom training, job rotation, consultant training, long distance learning, study visits, research/ publications, mentorship/ coaching, workshops/ seminars/ conference and involvement in professional associations and sabbatical leave.
The university librarians also indicated that staff were routinely rotated from one section to another, and some resigned to do similar jobs at other university libraries in Ghana. According to the university librarians and heads of department, a lot of considerations were taken into account before selecting library staff for training and development programmes. These included the qualifications and experience of the trainers, the availability of relevant and appropriate academic/professional programmes, the location of trainers or training institutions, accreditation of the trainers/institutions and the cost of the training programmes. The researchers found that one important criterion, the commitment of staff to work, was not considered. The university librarians and heads of department were, however, satisfied with the selection criteria of library staff for training.
The interviewees also reported that their institutional objectives for STDP were to equip library staff with the competencies needed to make them very effective and efficient so as to help the library and the institutions to achieve their goals/visions. STDP were implemented to achieve these objectives.
The findings on the contribution of STDP to work performance in the opinion of library staff respondents are presented in Table 5. Job rotation was the programme that had contributed most to library staff work performance, identified by a total of 99 (83.9%) respondents. This was followed by workshop/seminars/conferences 92 (78%) and classroom tra",5940,6724

University library is a very important arm of the of the university that holds significant commands in the conduct of problem-solving research, learning and teaching. It serves as a knowledge resort for students, faculty and researchers who are in need of information for advancing their knowledge frontier, learning, teaching, curriculum and intellectual fitness. Salman (2018) defines university library as an essential part of the institution saddled with the responsibilities of collecting and preserving recorded human knowledge and stores it in different media. Library is maintained for the benefit of students, lecturers and for those who are conducting research or pursuing certain information. It plays a significant role in the academic life of the students and faculty members by providing learning resources for educational use for the advancement of university objective. University libraries play a central role in the academic pursuit and research activities of students, lecturers and other members of the university community (Anyim, 2020). The primary objective of university libraries is to provide support for academic programme of the university including teaching, learning, research and community services in ways consistent with, and supportive of the institution's mission and goals.
University library occupies an important position in the university with onerous tasks that require effective performance of the employees. Effective job performance in university library is evident on the quality of service delivery by librarians that leads to meeting the information needs of the users. Different measures are adopted to ensure that the library meets the plethora of demands from the library users especially now that the information technologies are creeping into the library more rapidly. Moreover, due to the cut in funding of the library and shortage of library staff, there is need for cross-training and development of librarians to make the entire workforce well positioned to perform several tasks professionally. Cross-training an employee means, training a staff to learn to do the additional tasks that are being done in his or her department or worker A learns to do the work done by worker B and worker B learns to do the tasks of worker A (Vasanthi and Basariya, 2018) 
Effective Job Performance of Librarians in University Libraries
Effective job Performance is concerned with the relationship between inputs used to produce a service and satisfactory output or results of that service. Hose (2012) confirmed that effective job performance is the way members of the organization perform their job descriptions to attain expected outcome. Employees are expected to meet certain requirements that could be used to determine the effectiveness of their job performance. Abdullah, Bilau, Enegbuna, Ajagbe and Ali (2011) recognized the importance of job descriptions in pursuance of effective job performance and affirmed that employees perform well by following up-to-date job descriptions assigned to their positions. Effective job performance means the ability to perform library's function of selecting, acquiring, processing, organizing, preserving and conserving information resources, retrieving and disseminating of information to users with utmost professionalism. The university libraries should be proficient in utilizing every available tool to meet the users' information and curricular needs. This involves the use of human initiative, technological tools, talents and information literacy skills to diagnose and provide information solutions to students, faculty and other members of the university community.
Cross-training and development should be initiated in every university library for efficiency and effectiveness of job performance among librarians especially, in this era when information technologies have made library operations more volatile and sophisticated. Effective job performance involves a result-oriented approach which includes activities or behavior tailored toward accomplishing certain tasks with evidence of excellence. Achieving university libraries' goals and objectives is directly proportional to the job performance of librarian. Dutse (2011) posits that librarians' effective job performance could be assessed from their daily activities that involve operations such as book processing, selection, ordering, receiving, checking, stamping, classification and cataloguing, labeling, preparation for circulation, jacketing, final inspection and stacks maintenance, indexing and abstracting, preservation, shelving and shelf reading. It was believed by Ilgen and Schneider cited in Sonnentag and Frese (2001) that effective job performance is a set of actions which results are based on judgment and evaluative processes. However, job performance is evaluated based on organizational goals and objectives.
Effective job performance brings vibrancy and efficiency amongst librarians in attaining a goal and yielding of output or results (Chukwuka, 2010). Every organization including university library aims at high productivity which resulted from effective performance without which the goal and objective of the organization cannot be realized. Performance is the act of carrying out a command, duty or purpose for achieving the goals and objectives of the organization (university library). The command or action taken in carrying out a task is in accordance with the organizations requirements. Performance is defined as a way in which a person accomplishes a task that comprises his job. It indicates how the person is fulfilling the requirement of his or her position on the basis of result achieved.
In essence, performance is a cumulative effect of a person's effort as modified by his abilities and traits and by his role and perception. It can be evaluated by objective measures such as physical output or by subjective measures such as rating made by others or rating made by the individual himself.
For many organizations, the single most important personnel/human resources outcome involves the contributions that are generally called employee performance meaning how effectively an employee carries out job responsibilities and thereby making a contribution to the objectives of the organization (Anujulu, 2011) Effective job performance is a crucial factor in the government owned university library. It is a synergistic effort between the university library and individual librarians to ensure that expectations are met and objective results are achieved in compliance with the ethics of the library. From the forgoing, effective job performance could be seen as function of behavior and result. A well-controlled behavior in an organization determines how effectively a staff carries out his or her job responsibilities and thereby affecting the overall outputs of the organization. It has been observed by several authors that the strength of any organization lies on the effective job performance of the staff that makes up the workforce.
The strength of any university library is determined by the performance of the librarians. According to Mwita (2000), employee's effective job performance is an important building block of an organization. However government owned university library cannot progress by single person's efforts but by the collective efforts of all librarians within the library. Effective job Performance is a multi-dimensional phenomenon that aims at achieving a particular result with a strong link to strategic goals of the organization. Anufulu (2011) confirmed that employees are the life wire of any organization and that effective job performance is an important building block of any organization and because of that, the administrators of university libraries should take steps to design management control mechanisms where the latent and aroused motivation of employee are effectively and immediately responded to.
Effective job performance remains at the core of any organization. Management at any level have to strive to ensure maximum use of the staff talents, abilities and knowledge to improve their organizational outcomes through cross-training and development mechanisms. Earlier studies suggested that organizations should invest heavily in human resource development interventions to updates the skill of employees in order to attain maximum job performance. Through cross-training and development, libraries can be influenced and motivate into effective job performance (Popper, 2005).
Concept of Cross-Training and Development
Cross-training and development of provides members of the organization or departments a learning opportunity of how to perform various functions pertaining to the department or the organization to enable them become effective performers. Training and development is an indispensable element that has tremendous effect on job performance across every organization. University library is a dynamic institution where cross-training and development programme is heavily required especially now emerging technologies are changing the ways library operations are conducted. The future of university libraries lies on how competent the librarians are in discharging their respective duties.
Cross-training and development can increase viability and technical know-how of responding to other functions when called upon. Hartzell (2010) defines training as human resources management tools used for improving skills of the employees as to empower them enhance their job performance. Development on the other hand is defined as a continuous improvement of staff within any organization (Ugbokwe, 1998). Cross-training and development are deliberately used in this paper to focus on enhancement of librarians' competencies for achieving effective job performance. A study consulted by Anyim (2020) showed that several organizations are implementing cross-training of employees which has proved impactful in achieving competitive edge over other similar organizations as staff of the organizations can handle different functions effectively therefore, meeting the target goals of the industry. Jia-Fang (2010) supports the opinion when he opines that continuous periodic training and developing exercise impacts positively on the productivity of employees within an organization.
There is urgent cry for staff training and development occasioned by advances in Information and Communication technology especially in the area of university library operations. Librarians' training and development is a necessary approach through which the skills and competencies necessary for effective utilization of the emerging technologies are achieved among the library employees. According to Tai (2006), advances in technology have changed the pattern in which things are done in various organizations which results to changes in requirements of traits and competencies of performing different tasks.
To grapple with the contemporary advances in technologies, university libraries need more effective and enhanced training and development approaches to reposition the librarians to take advantage of the time. This training approach can transform the library into a more progressive learning environment and prepare librarians for effective service delivery. It can also make the university library to stay on top of its game in rendering effective library and information services with improved speed and accuracy. Cross-training and development program equip librarians with requisite technological competencies and skills in order to effectively utilize technical resources.
Cross-training and development is one of the approaches in human resource management that is well utilized in various organizations across the world. It is an indispensable element that has tremendous effect on service delivery (Anyim, 2020). As have been discovered by several organizations, cross-training has become an important measure of developing employees' knowledge, improving productivity and service delivery, and enabling staff exhibit positive work attitude (Okechukwu, 2012).
Method of Cross-Training and Development
There are several methods of cross-training and development mechanism that libraries could be adopted which are discussed below.
On-the-job training
On-the-job training also involves assigning extra tasks and responsibilities to trainees or subordinate employees by the manager or supervisor and allows him the autonomy for decision making by deliberately exposing him to challenging jobs and problem solving scenarios. According to Okechukwu (2012), on-the-job training includes instruction given to the trainees with detailed guide after which they are left to perform the assigned activities of the job. The trainer evaluates the learning ability of the trainees by assessing their abilities to follow instruction. He further states that the trainee is provided with the opportunity to attach him or herself with the trainer to help him or her gain insights into the relationship between theory and practice.
Off -the -job training
Though off -the -job training holds great promise like on-the-job-training, it also has certain disadvantages. For instance, this method is usually more expensive than on-the-job training and it does not allow on-the-spot assessment of training effectiveness which is possible with ""on-thejob"" training. There are various types of off-the-job training methods summarized by Okechukwu (2012) which include vestibule training. This method of training requires that the trainee moves out of his working environment to another place where resources, facilities, conditions and other equipment similar to what are obtainable in his own work place are provided for the training. The major constrain with this method is that it's relatively costly than other method.
Coaching and mentorship
Coaching and mentorship are also crucial in staff training. Okechukwu (2012) posits that employees directly learn from the trainer or coach, observe what the coach does and follow direct guidance of the coach. The advantage is that it allows the coach to give immediate feedback to the learners on whether they perform well or not. The managers also get themselves involved in learning to perform as much as possible, some of the supervisor's job. The reliability of this method however depends on how much responsibility the trainer is willing to allow the subordinate to handle.
Apprenticeship
Apprenticeship is another method of cross-training and development programme concerned with job that requires technical, special or diverse levels of skill and knowledge. It mostly runs in collaboration with the employees, the government and tertiary institutions like technical or vocational school) and labor unions. According to Okechukwu (2012), apprenticeship includes all kinds of trainings that are organized outside the employees' work station. It is usually organized in a training Centre. The aim of this method is to enhance the scope of trainee's job knowledge and expertise in order to improve on the method of operation for effective performance. It provides the trainees the opportunity of interacting with trainers who possess different skill, experience and knowledge in contrast to those they are used to back at work.
Seminar, workshop, briefing group and classroom learning
Seminar, workshop, briefing group and classroom methods are among the effective staff training methods identified by Okechukwu (2012). These are most common strategies used by the organizations in training and cross-training of their staff. It provides different group the opportunity to discuss and share views, ideas and opinion on a definite subject matter. A seminar is a medium used to stimulate the intellectual faculties of professionals. On the other hand, workshop provides practical demonstrations of what has been taught theoretically. Papers presented at these programs are constructively criticized and corrections are made. In briefing group, the trainer presents a concise paper that contains issues of technical concern or scenarios about a certain area of concern. It is assumed that the trainees have little or no idea of the issues in the paper.
The major pitfall of the above method is the variance in the abilities of trainees to articulate fast or get lost in the process. It doesn't give room for classroom interaction. The aim of this method is to impart new knowledge to the trainees. Classroom strategy is among the primary and less expensive form of training process used by different organizations. It involves the communication of precise information ideas, facts from the instructor to the trainees. One of the shortcomings of this method is the variance in the capacity of trainees to assimilate the ideas in the process.
Segregation of Duties
Separation of duties has been a long time practice in several organizations especially, in production and manufacturing companies. Service-oriented institutions such as libraries also find this management approach useful as it makes work easier. Aguolu (2008) opines that the essence of segregation of duties is that no one person should out three aspects of any transaction such as authorization, custodian and recording. Wittington and Pany (2008) states that management should maintain effective performance review and segregation of duties to enhance and facilitate effective implementation.
Duties should be segregated such that the work of one individual provides a crosscheck on the work of another individual"". Applying this in library system yields a better result. In the university library's cataloguing and classification tasks for example, such procedure ensures uniformity, consistency and accuracy. Separation of responsibilities or duties will enable an individual to record and process a complete business transaction. When there is separation of duties, it reduces the risk of intentional manipulation, mistakes or error and increases the element of checking. Duties to be separated include those of authorization of access, execution of project and record in case of a computer based library, system maintenance and daily operation (Adeniji, 2012 p. 47-55).
Aguolu (2008) stated that no one person is in a position both to commit fraud and conceal his action by falsifying the record. A case scenario in the library is when an acquisition librarian, after acquiring the books and the proper check is done to ensure materials received are consistent with what were ordered for before stamping and accessioning of the materials, then the materials are passed to the chief cataloguer for proper cataloguing before passing them to circulation librarian for users consumption. Chukwu (2010) emphasizes more on the importance of separation of duties between departments and individuals, such that an individual staff or department does not handle a particular activity from the beginning to the end. Aguolu (2008) however, opines that there should be adequate supervisory control. This implies that the job performed by one staff is subject to the approval of a higher official. This can be done by superior officials; scrutinizing the job of junior officers or subordinates; authorization from higher officials for a job to be performed; physical controls to ensure that specified corrective measures are carried out especially where an established control breaks down. Wittington and Pany (2008) reinstated that management should maintain effective performance review; information processing control and segregation of duties to enhance and facilitate effective implementation. Chukwu (2010) opines that effective job performance is attainable when an institution adopts segregation of duties with clear corporate objectives, plans, policies and duties of the employee in mind. He states further that management control system should be designed in such a way that access to assets is limited to the authorized personnel to avoid being misused, damaged and stolen.
Other strategies adopted by Chukwu (2010), include that transactions must be authorized or approved by a responsible and appropriate official. For instance, over time must be authorized by an appropriate officer. Additionally, management control system should be designed to ensure that the personnel operating the system are competent, reliable, has integrity and adequately motivated to carry out the duties assigned to them. Activities carried out by all levels of personnel should be clearly laid down and communicated to the staff being supervised. When the above strategies are employed with acknowledgement and reward of librarians' exceptional job performance, it is believed that performance of librarians in their respective duties will improve significantly.
Duties Rotation
Duty rotation is a management strategy used to keep staff acquainted with activities in other departments by moving him or her from one unit of the organization to another. It involves the movement of an employee from one unit or department, task or responsibility to another after a stint in a particular departmrnt, task, responsibility for the purpose of creating a balance culture where the employees have the opportunity to acquire more skills, talents and knowledge. It is also an in-house training undergone by the members of an organization ranges from senior management staff to the lowest officers. Oparanma and Nwaeke (2015) opine that the skills and knowledge obtained from a job rotation improves productivity, and that job rotation helps management in detecting and correcting irregularities in the organization and also broaden ones outlook, knowledge, skill, and contact.
Seminar, Workshop, Briefing Group and Classroom Learning
Seminar, workshop, briefing group and classroom methods are among the effective staff training methods identified by Okechukwu (2012). These are most common strategies used by the organizations in training their staff. It provides different group the opportunity to discuss and share views, ideas and opinion on a definite subject matter. A seminar is a medium used to stimulate the intellectual faculties of professionals. On the other hand, workshop provides practical demonstrations of what has been taught theoretically. In briefing group, the trainer presents a concise paper that contains issues of technical concern or scenarios about a certain area of concern. It is assumed that the trainees have little or no idea of the issues in the paper.
The major pitfall of this method is the variance in the abilities of trainees to articulate fast or get lost in the process. It doesn't give room for classroom interaction. The aim of this method is to impart new knowledge to the trainees. Classroom learning is among the primary and less expensive form of training process used by different organizations. It involves the communication of precise information ideas, facts from the instructor to the trainees. One of the shortcomings of this method is the variance in the capacity of trainees to assimilate the ideas in the process.
Cross-training and development should be a tool in the hands of the management to advance knowledge frontiers of librarians and other supporting staff in order to remain relevant in the fast changing library environment and roles in the information age. The varieties of training methods discussed above can be of great benefits to the university libraries in the following ways: The training will enhance the job performance of librarians; the training will change the attitude and mentality of the librarians to project a good image or loyalty before the library; the librarians can now work with little or no supervision with relative speed and accuracy; through the training, the old librarians would be updated therefore mitigating the risk of obsolesce. Finally, through the training, the librarians become flexible to adapt to any occasional or long term variation. Jones, George and Hill (2006) opine that the essence of training and development is to teach organizational members how to perform their current and other jobs and helping them acquire the knowledge and skills they need to be effective performers.
Challenges of Cross-training and Development
Leads to Distraction: Cross-training makes employees be like ""jack of all trade"" in which they may be pulled out of the important task they have at hand without accomplishing it, and then switch to another task. Vasanthi and Basariya (2018) observed that as cross-training teaches employees something of everything; it spreads their understanding and capabilities over a wide range of skills and tasks. For this reason, a person who was hired for a specific position may lose focus compared to multi task performers.
Employee's Lack of Enthusiasm to Work:
Employees feel threatened when their job is transferred to another staff that is new in the role simply because he or she just learned the skill through cross-training. It makes the former performer of the role feel less important and this leads to lose confidence and demoralized. Vasanthi and Basariya (2018) affirmed that taking responsibilities away from one staff and handing them onto another staff can adversely affect an employee's confidence and that could be even worse when those responsibilities are transferred to someone who just learned the skills required to perform them.
Dissatisfaction:
As more job responsibilities assigned to one employee due to his multiple skills, the staff may feel overwhelmed with work making him or her to feel overused. This can lead to job dissatisfaction especial when remuneration is not commensurable to assigned tasked. According to Vasanthi and Basariya (2018), if a staff is assigned with more responsibilities, there is a chance that the staff may feel dissatisfied as more work is being pulled out from him. This may lead to employees' aggrieved feeling being directed towards their tasks / supervisor.
Prospects of Cross-training and Development
Improved Multitasking Ability: Cross-training and development of employees enable staff to be acquainted with every aspect of job performed in their organization. This makes employees flexible in performing various kinds of tasks. Even when there is shortage of workforce, the organization cannot be inhibited from fulfilling their objectives as the available employees can carry out different job specifications. In the same vein, Vasanthi and Basariya (2018) asserted that ""employees who can perform a variety of tasks provide flexibility and help to minimize downtime in the factory. Broad skill set of employees improves their overall value to the company and flexibility in planning work assignments.""
Self-confidence: Cross-trained employees tend to exhibit positive work attitude and selfconfidence. It gives librarians sense of belonging as they can have a touch of everything that is done in their library and produce more results. Vasanthi and Basariya (2018) state that crosstrained employees feel more valuable, and they are normally more secure in their roles within the organization and as a result of strong morale; productivity often increases and employee turnover decreases. Cost Reduction: It is less expensive to cross-train employees than to external recruitment of new employee. University libraries can leverage on cross-training of librarians in order to reduce cost since their major challenge appears to be inadequate funding by the constituent authorities. According to Vasanthi and Basariya (2018), employees acquire new skills after attending cross training exercise; therefore, cross-training can be used as substitutes instead of recruiting fresh employees. Furthermore, changing employee roles and assigning duties to an existing workforce is always less costly than conducting an external recruitment campaign. Thus cross training reduces the running cost of the organization.
It makes
Value-Added: Cross-training leads to professional and personal growths which are altogether a value-added to the quality of service delivery in the university library. Cross-training adds value to the employee and also to the business. An employee puts more effort when more responsibilities are assigned to him or her as it helps to develop both personally and professionally (Vasanthi and Basariya, 2018) Increased Employee Motivation: Cross-training improves motivation and promotes job satisfaction among members of the staff. The employees feel loved and recognized by their employers when they are given the opportunity to learn new skills and to advance in their professional skills. To them, cross training means a worthwhile professional growth. Vasanthi and Basariya (2018) opine that employees get motivated not only with monitory benefits but also with non-monetary recognition. Cross training of employees motivates staff to be more committed and satisfied with their job because it shows that the institution is investing the necessary values and resources for them to acquire new skills.
Improved Employees' Work Attitude:
When employees enjoy their work, their work attitude improves significantly and it reflects on their job performance. Cross-training of librarians is not only intended to improve the skills of librarians but also to grant them job satisfaction. According to Vasanthi and Basariya (2018), employees will be confident when they are provided with quality cross training thus, it will have positive effect on employee morale leading them to work harder, be more productive and stay longer periods of time with the organization they are working for.
Conclusion
The strength of any organization dwells on the performance of the employees that make up the organization. University library can only boast of robust impact on academic life of the students and faculty when the librarians perform exceptionally in providing effective library services. Cross-training will improve librarians' job performance and the image of the library. Crosstraining enables librarians to perform all the operations of the library in various library departments. The prospects of cross-training seem to be more enormous than the challenges and could be adopted for enhancing job performance of librarians. Though cross-training employees may be considered cost effective, its challenges should also be considered. Libraries should not neglect the importance of adequate staffing and the law of departmentalization of duties. Crosstraining can have both positive and negative effects depending on how it is implemented. Factors like technology and culture of a university system should be considered before implanting crosstraining programme.
University libraries should adopt the above methods of training to advance the knowledge frontiers of librarians and other supporting staff in order to remain relevant in the fast changing library environment and roles of librarians in the information age. The varieties of training methods discussed above can be of great benefits to the university libraries in the following ways: enhancement the job performance of librarians; improving the work attitude and mentality of the librarians to project a good image or loyalty before the library; the librarians can now work with little or no supervision with relative speed and accuracy; through cross-training, the old librarians would be updated therefore mitigating the risk of obsolesce. Finally, cross-training makes the librarians become flexible to adapt to any occasional or long term variation.",5496,6204

Staff performance is a very crucial aspect of librarianship when it comes to provision of library services in any university library. In this context, the role of library staff of any sort is very paramount in satisfying the information needs of their teeming users. Given the nature of work, the degree of stress and the working hours that the human capital of university library have; studying factors that have an impact on their job attitude becomes a necessity for the library management. Performance of such employees is influenced by Job related attitudes like satisfaction, leadership, work commitment and job involvement.Employee performance is the summation of commitment and involvement towards their organization and its value. An employee with positive attitude is well aware about the dynamics of business, can fine tune to organisational environment, leading to a holistic development in the performance and productivity of the entire organization. Keeping these facets as background, this research paper investigates the impact and factors that lead to better productivity of library staff members. An empirical investigation was done to identify the factors that have a bearing on work attitudes and the survey was carried out in the university library. Statistically the information was tested and validated. P test, F test, correlation and regression showed a significant relationship between the attitudes of library staff and performances. This study suggested some human resource development policies in libraries to creating more positive attitude on the staff.
",2012,A Management Journal,,"Introduction
Job related attitude which according to Timothy, Kammeyer-Muller and John (2012), is a set of evaluation of one's job that constitute one's feelings towards, belief about and attachment to one's job and organisational performance are the fundamental research issues in industrial psychology. The relationship between these factors is essential in every organisation for maintaining efficiency of a business enterprise. Several studies which examined the level of productivity of similar industries and establishments found that some enterprises persistently operate much more efficiently than others. (Gibbons and Henderson, 2012). According to Bandiera et al. (2007), the role of human resource management practices in similar enterprises which explained the persistent productivity differences are now receiving considerable weight age in both intra-industrial and cross industrial studies. While Platis (2015) hints that Job performance is considered as an imperative parameter in every profession including librarianship. Generally, work of the Manager is to delegate job and give information to co-workers.
Facts regarding the possible link between manager-worker relation and job performance would allow the application of appropriate structures for organization, and consequently lead to better output for the business An effective and productive organisation requires its manpower to be happy and content with their job profiles so that they can put in their efforts for the overall growth of the organization. It is important to identify the variables associated with the employee and organizational performance which have an impact on worker's performance and attitude in organization. Employees are expecting the company to enhance their performance by giving proper training and motivation. In the words of Fritzsche and Parrish (2005), a happy worker is a productive worker. This expectation plays a significant role in deciding employee attitude and the employee work performance.
Attitude has a direct impact on work performance of an employee. There are number of other variables that affect employee work related attitude on employee job performance. The study focuses on variables that are considered to have impact on workplace behaviour of employee, leadership, job satisfaction, commitment, motivation and training.
Job satisfaction is a significant area of research; it is correlated factor which can enhance job performance. Various studies have defined that job satisfaction and job performance have a vital relation to a business. The most famous researchers and writers accepted that the job satisfaction can affect work performance of the employees in the organization. There are also specific conditions such as mood and worker level within the organization identified that the job satisfaction and job performance connection depends the social exchange theory; worker's performance is giving back to the business from which they get their fulfillment. Since service sector is dominated by people, focus on factors that lead to satisfaction of employees is dominant here. Health sector is one area which is people predominant. The sector can survive only when enough importance is given to manpower.
The library is one of the key systems in a society which needs to function systematically. The provision of library services has become major criterion to establishing the worth of academic programs of any university especially in Nigeria. The fact is that many university libraries in Nigeria including Alex Ekwueme Federal University are not only under-funded; they are also inadequately stocked with needed books and other information material as well as inadequate manpower. Inasmuch as these university libraries are not meeting up with the information needs of their users, they remain principle source of information for both the academia and students towards meeting the tripartite functions of the librarywhich are: teaching, learning and research. The performances of staff of the university library can be assessed on timeliness of attending to users and attending to enquiries; regular evaluation of information needs of users, availability of needed information source, effective communication and ability to rapport with users and create the desired goodwill for continuity among others. Several studies proved that performance of Librarians and behavior in the library is related to job satisfaction, It is only if and when the library staff is satisfied with his job, that the library can expect better performance from him. The International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) has rightly pointed out that libraries should not be viewed only as information centres but also as social organizations. Thus, in addition to meeting the needs of users, the library must also develop a healthy work environment in which individual employees and employee groups can meet their expected performance by self-developing job related attitude by which they satisfy their needs and desires to serve the best interest of the organization and the users. Low level of job satisfaction among library staff may affect their relationship with users and this may compromise quality of services rendered.
This study is an attempt to bridge the macro and micro perspectives by developing a framework and ❖ To establish the relationship between organizational commitment and job performance of the library staff; ❖ To discover the relationship between leadership and job performance of staff in the library,.
❖ To find the impact of the job satisfaction, job involvement, Organizational commitment and organizational leadership on job performance.

Conceptual framework of the study
Employees Job performance is the essential factors in commercial analytics for keeping and raising efficiency for businesses. Job performance is defined as the extent to which one completes the duties that are important to carry in a given place. Common works of managers are to delegate job and give info to co-workers. In admitting that it is the responsibility of managers to certify Job performance is at ultimate impending. Facts regarding the possible link between manager-worker connection and job performance would allow the application of more real structures for organization, and consequently, better output for the business over enlarged job performance.
Job Satisfaction
Job satisfaction is defined as a positive or pleasant emotional state resulting from a person's appreciation of his/her own job or experience (Locke, 1976). Leap and Crino (1993) viewed job satisfaction as the attitude of workers toward their job, rewards that they get, the social, organizational, and physical characteristics of the environment in which they perform their working activities. Robbins (2003) sees job satisfaction as the general attitude of an individual toward his/her job.
Leadership
Leaders have been identified as ethical stewards who create organisational systems which support their values (Caldwell et al., 2008). Dhar and Mishra (2001) assert that in services, leadership is about purpose-process-people, rather than strategy-structure-systems; therefore, leadership is vital to attract the best talent and best leverage their skills and knowledge. Leaders are intrinsic to the adoption of brand values. Edmonson and Cha (2002) explain that leaders are assessed, amongst other metrics, on the basis of their perceived brand values.
Organisational Commitment
Organizational commitment is defined as the employee's feelings of obligation to stay with the organization: feelings resulting from the internalization of normative pressures exerted on an individual prior to entry or following entry. According to Meyer and Allen (1991) organizational commitment can take three distinct forms. Affective commitment refers to identification with, involvement in, and emotional attachment to the organization, in the sense that employees with strong affective commitment remain with the organization because they want to do so. Continuance commitment refers to commitment based on employee's recognition of the costs associated with leaving the organization.
Job Involvement
Work involvement refers to employee perceptions of the concern and dedication who show for their job (Billings and Moos, 1982) Generally, a workplace appraised as consisting of motivated employees, willing to do more than just put in their time,' is apt to be interpreted as beneficial (James, James and Ashe, 1990).
Job Performance
Job performance is one of the most important dependent variable. Borman and Motowidlo (1993) identified two types of employee behavior that are necessary for organizational effectiveness as task performance and contextual performance. Contextually, they defined performance as individual efforts that are not directly related to their main task functions. According to Werner (2000), these behaviors are important because they shape the organizational, social, and psychological contexts serving as the critical catalyst for task activities and processes. He explains that Job performance depends upon various factors which include: Job Attitude, Job Satisfaction, Job Involvement, leadership and organisational commitment. All these factors influence vital role in performance of employees in an organisation.
Theoretical and Empirical Framework
Long (1979) explored the how employee /ownership may be related to job attitudes, job behaviour, and organisational performance. Tracing the relationships between employee, ownership, job attitudes and organisational performance and the variables which moderate these relationships, the central premise is that employee ownership may affect job attitudes both directly through the effects of individual share ownership and indirectly by changing patterns of organisation influence and employee participation in decisions.
Bhatnagar Deepthi (1987) studied impact of training programmes to explore the attitude towards women workers in management cadre in Indian banks. The study revealed that there was a marked difference in male and female attitudes towards women in the managerial positions i.e. female respondents have more positive attitudes for most of the attributes. Shore and Wayne (1993) found that continuance commitment is negatively related to organisational commitment base. He further explained that organisational members who feel bound to their employing organisation because of an accrual of side bets are less inclined to perform organisational commitment base. In the workplace, employees'organisational commitment base is likely to result in thoughts of sharing knowledge. Judge et al. (2001) identified three major gaps between human resource practice and the scientific research in the area of employee attitudes in general and the most focal employee attitude in particular. These are: job satisfaction which affects employee attitudes which may result to positive or negative job satisfaction and also measure and influence employee attitudes. Study also revealed how to close the gaps in knowledge and evaluating implemented practices.
Raymond Loi et al. (2004) examined the effect of professional identification on several job attitudes (i.e., job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and career satisfaction), and explored the moderating roles of gender and organizational tenure on these relationships. Their analysis revealed that (1) Professional identification had a significant positive effect on both job satisfaction and organizational commitment;
(2) Gender moderated the relationship between professional identification-job satisfaction and professional identification, organizational commitment, and
(3) Organizational tenure moderated the relationship between professional identification and job satisfaction as well as the relationship between professional identification and career satisfaction. Jones et al. (2008), study on the pervasiveness of role overload on job attitudes, turnover intentions and performance revealed that the job attitude for more experienced executives was more adversely affected by role overload than that for less experienced executives. Furthermore, while the differences between the means were not significant, the results suggested that work experience moderated the relationship between role overload and turnover intent. Thus, it is noteworthy that role overload has displayed inconsistent relationships with many job attitudes, turnover intentions and performance measures. The study was unable to obtain performance scores other than self-reports, possibly inducing common method bias. Walumbwa (2008), opined that transformational leadership was positively associated with follower identification with work unit and self-efficacy of employees and found that transformational leadership would be positively related to individual identification with the work unit and self-efficacy. Singh et al. (2010), state that job attitudes, such as work commitment and job satisfaction, have attracted academic and professional attention for several reasons. In this study the effects of gender on job attitudes was investigated. The findings indicate that men and women have different attitudes towards their jobs. The results suggest support for the job model perspective; that is, women and men have similar job attitudes once we control for work-related and other variables Bartel et al. (2011) found that distinctive workplace component to employee attitudes despite the common set of corporate human resource management practices that cover all the branches. Differences in the branch-level measures of employee attitudes across branches are highly significant and are too large to be explained by chance alone. Moreover, study also observed that the attitudes of new employees converge with the pre-existing attitudes of their longer-tenured co-workers, either through changes in employee attitudes over time or through turnover. The study also reveals that cross-branch differences in attitudes are highly correlated with sales performance of the branches-branches in which employees have more favorable attitudes have superior sales performance. Abbas et al. (2012.) opined that job attitude also determines the productivity of the employees in various sectors of the industry. Study also found that Banking professionals were most content with working conditions and least with financial terms. Gender have not played major significant difference in the level of job satisfaction. Abdullah and Ramay (2012), posit that the relation between job security and organisational commitment was the most significant followed by work environment. Pay satisfaction and participation in decision making had low correlations with organisational commitment. Age and tenure seemed to affect the commitment of employees, with higher commitment shown for higher age and tenure whereas gender did not show significant change in commitment level of employees. The study could not bring in the effects of three components of commitment and their relation in the existing study Pakkerrappa (2012) studied that the analysis of the levels of satisfaction of respondents working for public sector and private sector banks shows that though the overall level of satisfaction is similar for both the sectors the emphasis on various factors that affect the level of satisfaction is different. Given the higher level of job security and autonomy employees in the public sector associate their level of satisfaction with people related issues like supervisors, peers and training, whereas employees in public sector are more affected by work related issues like autonomy & financial rewards. Gopalan et al. (2013) examined the performance motivation of community health workers (CHWs) and its determinants on India's Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) programme. The study discovered that there is no correlation between the level of dissatisfaction on the incentives and the extent of motivation. The study established inadequate healthcare delivery status and certain working modalities reduced their motivation. Trivellas et al. (2013) studied the impact of job related stress on Job Satisfaction of nursing staff working in hospitals. Their study found that, Job stress is one of the most important workplace health risks for employees, and job satisfaction has been considered as a crucial factor in the provision of high quality services and superior performance at hospitals. Their study results showed that conflict, heavy workload and lack of job autonomy are negatively associated with all job satisfaction dimensions, while shortage in information access and feedback is positively related to employees'satisfaction with rewards and job security. Ang et al. (2013) examined the effects of management and employee perceptions of high-performance work systems (HPWS) on human resource (HR) outcomes. Their study found that only when management's implementation of HPWS is like employees adopted HR practices that HPWS are translated into greater engagement, job satisfaction, affective commitment and less intention to leave.
Their results had implications for the management of employees in any library and the implementation of HPWS for different occupations within an organisation. Suresh. et al. (2015) opined that, in health sector domains like interpersonal relationship and working condition, Doctors were highly satisfied, whereas rest of the domains: Organizational functioning, Financial incentives, Non-financial incentives, and Physical facilities doctors were moderately satisfied.
In their study, demographic variable like age and gender both shown significant association on level of satisfaction whereas experience, designation and marital status of the doctors have not shown significant association. Suresh, S., & Kodikal, R. (2015) opined that over all Managerial skill is contributed more by Technical skill then followed by Human skill and lastly, Conceptual skills. They also found that employees satisfaction with job and managerial skill has an impact on job performance. Their study also revealed that Demographic variables such as Age, Marital status, Professional qualification and experience have no significant impact on job satisfaction and managerial skills of employees. Sharma, J. et al. (2016) studied that the level of burnout is significantly higher among the staff and had an inverse relation with affective commitment. Further, their finding perceived organizational support and procedural justice showed a positive relation with affective commitment in contrast to burnout and found affective commitment had a strong impact on job performance of the staff. Kodikal and Rahiman (2016) opined that there is low level of relationship between quality of work life and organizational commitment in manufacturing sector. Their study contributed to the existing literature and suggested some human resource development strategies to improve quality of work life, so that commitment of employees could improve.
In their study on work related attitudes on job performance of health workers in India, Rahiman and Kodikal (2017), conclude that though performance of employees and all the four factors (job attitude, job involvement, job satisfaction, job leadership and commitment are different they are so interwoven and influence each other.
Research Methodology

Area of Study
The area of study is the Library of Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ikwo, Ebonyi State. The university is one of the nine new Federal Universities that were set up by Former President of Nigeria, Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan (GCFR) on the February 26, 2011 in order to expand access to quality education to all parts of Nigeria and to produce knowledge that will support the nation's economy and its industries. The university focuses on Excellence and Integrity. It is located in Southeastern part of Nigeria. The university Library was established alongside the parent institution -FUNAI. It has staff strength of 110 comprising 5 professional Librarians including the University Librarian, 10 library officers while others are junior library staff.
Population of Study.
The population of this study is all staff of Alex Ekwueme Federal University Library. They include: all junior staff, library officers and librarians totaling 110.
Population Sample
The census sampling method was applied, in which case, 110 respondents were considered. The analysis consisted of demographic variables to Job Performance, Job attitude, job commitment and Job involvement, Job satisfaction and leadership related questions.
Method of Data collection
The researcher applied the survey methodology in which case, the questionnaire was used as the principle tool for data collection. The primary data was collected on the basis of census sampling method ensuring that all employees of the library were involved. The questionnaires were personally administered and collected by the researcher within an interval of two days. 
Presentation of Data

Result Analysis
Various statistical analyses were employed to compare the scores of the respondents from the libraries on different factors which influences job related attitudes on performance. Demographic variable of the employees is closely related to their performance. Using various statistical tools impact of job related attitude and performance of employees on demographic variable were tested.
The analysis of gender shows, that Male staff was 34 representing 31% and Female 76 representing 69% of the workforce. In addition, marital status shows that 36.4% or 40 of the participants were single and 63.6% representing 70 respondents were married. The years of work experience of the participants ranges from 0 to15 years and above The responses were classified as follows: 25% (n = 27) were in range of less than 1 years, 50% (n = 55) were in the range of 1-5years, 23% (n = 26) between 5 and 10 years, 2% (n = 2) in the range of more than 15 years. The year of age of the respondent, participants ranges from 25 to 55 years.
The respondents were classified as follows; a large population 60% (n=67) were between 25-35 years of age, 36% (n=39) were in the range of 35-45 years, only 4% (n=4) were in the range of 45-55 years.
In the case of impact of organisational leadership, male respondents (31%) seem to be more contented than female (69%), in the area of marital status, married respondents 63.6% are happier than unmarried 36.4% respondent. In the case of age and experience, younger respondents are more compliance with organisational regulation than senior employees.
Job commitment generally contributes more to productivity of organisation. The result shows that, male respondents representing 31% of the respondents are more committed than female counterparts of 69%, while in the area of marital status, married respondents (70) or 63.6% are more committed than the unmarried 40 respondents. Data collected under age and experience of respondents, show that junior and middle level library employees are more committed than senior and more experienced employees. Job involvement usually increases performance of the employees. It can be deduced from the result that male library staff members are more involved than their female counterparts in high job performance and productivity while married staff are less involved in negative job attitude than the unmarried. The result also shows that senior and experienced library staff members are more involved in playing truancy than the junior and less experienced employees.
(see tables 1-4)
Testing of Hypotheses
H01: There is no significant relationship between job commitment and job satisfaction
The analysis of the result of data collected, shows that Null hypothesis H01 was rejected as F-test =2.51, P<0.05, at 0.05 level of significance. It implies that a significance relationship exists among the dimensions which include: Job satisfaction and Job commitment of employees in the library.
H02:
There is no significant relationship between job satisfaction and productivity.
When administered data was statistically validated the hypothesis at 0.05 level of significance; the null hypothesis (H02) was rejected and significant relationship found between job satisfaction and productivity.
H03:
There is no significant relationship between leadership and productivity.
Analyzed result indicated that P value is than 0.05 and the data is statistically validated the hypothesis at 0.05 level of significant; the null hypotheses H03 was rejected. This proves that there is positive level of significance found between leadership and productivity.
H04:
There is no significant relationship between job commitment and productivity.
When Pearson correlation coefficient was administered to statistically validate the hypothesis at 0.05 level of significant; the null hypothesis was rejected and study revealed significant relationship between employee's job commitment and productivity.
H05:
There is no significant relationship between job involvement and productivity.
As per the analysis null hypothesis rejected was as F value =2.396 and P value found to be .04 which is less than 0.05 in same significant level. This therefore proves that job involvement and productivity of the employees have significant relationship.
H06:
There is no significant relationship between works related attitude and Job performance.  
Conclusion/Recommendation
In conclusion, with the result of the analyzed data in this research, it is obvious that there is a correlation between organisational leadership, job satisfaction, job involvement, commitment and job attitude in providing effective services to the library clients but in all, job attitude, remains the most important factor for effective library services in an academic environment.
The staff job attitude must be positive if the university library is to achieve her stated objectives.
Imperatively, the positive attitudes of library staff towards their jobs remain the library major tool for marketing the services of the library to her public as failure to be portray danger to effective functioning of the library and her management. This development can also make the library irrelevant within the university community as the patrons are likely going to look for alternative sources to obtain their needed information knowing full well that the world has become a global village with birth of information and communication technology (ICT).
The university management must therefore, do everything possible to build a systematic human resource management if she wish to meet the expectations and objectives of the library as well as enhance the staff performance and productivity.
To enhance the work performance of the library staff therefore, the researcher is of the opinion that the library management should implement the following suggestions:
❖ There is the need to make the entire library workforce to understand the importance of working as a team realising that each unit of the library compliments one another;
❖ The experienced and old staff of the library should see themselves as the library's power-house and should encourage and mentor the young/fresh staff towards performing optimally by exemplary leadership;
❖ The library management should encourage excellence and commitment to duty of any staff through training and re-training as well as the application of other approved motivational incentives;
❖ The married women should be made to understand the difference between the home front and an office by ensuring that redundancy and apathy to assigned duties are not tolerated. This can be achieved through punishing offenders accordingly;
❖ Management should come up with stringent punitive measures (eg: seizure of allowances) against staff with negative job attitude so as to serve as deterrent to other staff who may be nursing such act;
❖ Every library staff responsibility must be defined and closely monitored by Unit Heads and offenders properly disciplined as stipulated in the university's Code of Conduct, ❖ Finally, the act of marketing products of any sort by staff during working hours at the detriment of their work should be out rightly discouraged.",5191,5820

The study investigated the effect of training and motivation on job performance of library personnel of University of Lagos, Lagos State, Nigeria. Observation show that library users frequently complain that library staff do not attend to their queries properly. This phenomenon could be attributed to lack of training and motivation to the library personnel. Survey method was used in the study. The population comprised 135 library personnel in the University of Lagos. Total enumeration was employed as sample size. Out of 135 copies of questionnaire distributed to the respondents, 91 were completed and returned. Analysis was done based on the returned copies of the questionnaire. Statistical methods used were frequency count (presented in tables), mean and standard deviation. The result of the study showed that training motivates library personnel in University of Lagos to do their jobs. In turn, this enhances their performance on the job. Therefore, the study recommends that regular training should be given to library personnel, not only in the University of Lagos but elsewhere, as this would result in increased productivity, availability of skilled workforce and personal growth.
",2014,OALib,"Scientific Research Publishing, Inc.","Introduction
In the present global economy, most employers have realized that for their organization to compete and be successful, the performance of their employees is very important. several mechanisms in place to ensure that optimum job performance is achieved. Job performance, according to Munchinsky, is the set of an employee's behaviour that can be monitored, measured, and assessed at individual level. These behaviours are also in agreement with the organizational goals [1]. Hence, Saetang, Sulumnad, Thamppitak and Sungkaew believe that job performance is a human behaviour which the result is an important factor for individual work effectiveness evaluation [2]. Therefore, it is argued that optimum performance within the library is related to achieving the quality, quantity, cooperation, dependability and creativity of the library personnel. Job performance needs to comply with knowledge acquisition, skills development and of course good personal values, which come as a reward of the employee having an annual salary increase and promotion. It is expected that certain measures need to be put in place to encourage and motivate workers to perform up to expectation; these measures include but not limited to training.
Training, according to Cole, is a learning activity which is directed towards the acquisition of specific knowledge and skills for the purpose of an occupation or task [3]. In the same vein, De Cenzo and Robbins posit that training is basically a learning experience, which seeks a relatively permanent change on individual's skills, knowledge, attitudes or social behavior [4]. This implies that there is need to improve employee's skills and knowledge so that he or she becomes efficient to work on both present and future jobs and tasks. A prominent benefit of training is that it eliminates risks in organizations. Since the trained personnel are efficient, they are able to make better use of the organizations property, thereby reducing and avoiding waste. Training would help employees to master knowledge, skills, behaviors, sense of self-worth and confidence which in turn motivate them to perform efficiently and improve on the performance of the organization.
Motivation, on the other hand, is that guiding principle that enables people to stay focused on the path to success, regardless of the challenges they encounter in their attempts to achieve personal and professional goals and targets [5]. Generally, human beings long to be motivated in other to perform effectively. According to Adeyemo, motivation is a human psychological characteristic that contributes to a person's degree of hard work and trust. It is seen as something which is good, and one cannot feel good with oneself if he or she is not motivated. It is a basic psychological process, which is also considered as predictor of job performance [6]. As Akpa aptly argues, ""Employee motivation is very important and vital in organization and in any job if people are to give their best"" [7]. Thus, the determinants of optimum job performance are training and motivation. It is therefore important that appropriate training should be given to library personnel in order to motivate them for efficiency and optimum performance. However, it is important to state that past studies have shown other factors that could motivate individual employees, especially as revealed in Herzberg's two-factor theory [8]. But the focus of this study is on how training motivates library employees to perform their jobs.
Statement of the Problem
The library helps in providing and solving the information needs of different users: students, lecturers, and other researchers. This is done through the assistance of the library personnel at various levels. However, research and observation show that most times users complain that library staff do not attend to their query properly, which could be attributed to lack of training and motivation which as a result, affects their job performance. This study therefore, seeks to investigate the effect of training and motivation on job performance of library personnel in University of Lagos, Nigeria.
Objectives of the Study
The specific objectives of the study are to:
1) Find out if training is given to library personnel in University of Lagos.
2) Establish the type of training given to library personnel at University of Lagos.  Training is defined as a short term process utilizing a systematic and organized procedure by which non-managerial personnel learn technical knowledge and skills for a definite purpose [9]. When employees are trained, they get their skills improved and develop progression in their skills that will enhance their productivity and performance and subsequently complete their tasks on time. Moreover, Iqbal, Nabi, Muneer, and Anuar contend that training outputs ought to emphasize performance, not just learning, which is the employer's expectations from training; that is why training has such a pivotal role in organizations. The employees have several expectations associated with training as well so full of career expansion opportunities [10]. Training can be motivator for personnel to enhance dedication to organizational performance. Yalokwu emphasized the need for training by stating that it is important that all employees be inducted into training programmes to improve their job-related knowledge, skills and performance [11]. Madukoma and Nwosu stated that there are many levels of training including orientation, initial job training. They further observe that while some are received by every employee, others are customized to meet individualized employee needs [12]. Obi and Zakari identified in-house service training, workshops, seminars, conferences, job rotation, continuing education, personalized training, orientation, internships, on-the-job coaching as types of training [13]. Yalokwu broadly classified methods of training as on-the-job, off-the-job, stimulation methods and information presentation methods [11]. All these types of training help to equip staff as well as motivate them to perform well on their jobs.
Daw has tressed that in view of the importance of staff training in university libraries, libraries should ensure regular training development of all staff; encourage the illiterate staff to attend adult literacy classes to ensure their retention and progress; and all staff, where appropriate, to go for higher education [14]. Similarly, American Association of Law Libraries emphasized that the library personnel is responsible for the maintenance of the library and therefore is required to go through some training to equip him or her for the task ahead [15]. Thus, training of library personnel is crucial for the development and success of the library.
Motivation and Job Performance of Library Personnel
According to Hackett, motivation is the process that starts with psychological deficiency or need that activates a behavior or a drive that is aimed at a good incentive [16]. Hence, Abonam ascertains that it is widely recognized that motivation plays a role in keeping an employee performing his/her best in any task assigned. Motivated employees help organization survive and are more productive. Therefore, to be effective, managers need to motivate employees within the context of the roles they perform; and the achievement of individuals and organizational goals are independent process linked by employee work motivation [17]. Simlarly, Stueart and Moran see motivation at work as the sum of processes that influence the arousal, direction, and maintenance of behaviours relevant to work setting [18]. In the opinion of Akpa, ""In as much as it is almost impossible for the management of today's complex organizations to satisfy all their employees, they should strive to satisfy and motivate a majority of their employees so as to enhance job satisfaction, increase productivity and reduce the rate of employee turnover"" [19]. Thus, library personnel should be motivated by giving them training in different environments and circumstances. These in effect will help them acquire different skills that will boast their job. Consequently, Campbell posits that in order to ensure job and career security, it is important for employees to continually update and expand their work experiences and job skills [20]. These are likely to be achieved when the worker is equipped through training.
There are many factors that can motivate personnel to put their maximum in their jobs; these include but not limited to good salary packages, conducive working environment, regular promotion, good communication climates, staff training and development. It is important to note that all personnel cannot be motivated by the same motivating factor and have the same motivating effect at a time. Hence the focus of this study is on training as a precursor to motivation and job performance. not only on the amount of physical effort exerted but also on the person's mental ability [21]. This implies that employees will put in their best in performing their jobs if they are motivated perhaps through training. Furthermore, Johari and Yahya stated that job performance has become one of the significant indicators in managing organizational performance. Moreover, growing emphasis has been given on employee's job performance as a source of competitive advantage to promote responsiveness in enhancing overall organizational effectiveness [22]. Afful-Bronistated that individual performance is generally determined by three factors; namely, abilitythe capability to do the job; work environment-the tools, materials and information needed to do the job; and motivation-the desire to do the job [23]. Employees that are given required training would be equipped for the job in all ramifications.
Job Performance of Library Personnel

Methodology
Descriptive survey research design was employed to carry out this study. The population of study cut across all strata of professionals, para-professionals and library assistants at the university of Lagos library giving a total number of 135 staff. The sampling technique used was total enumeration, thus involved the entire population of the study. A structured questionnaire was the instrument used for data collection. One hundred and thirty-five (135) copies of the questionnaire were distributed to the library staff of University of Lagos. Out of this number, ninety-one (91) were duly completed and retrieved. All retrieved copies were valid and used for data analysis.
Presentation of Result
Data analysis was based on the retrieved copies of the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, such as frequency and percentage presented in tables, mean and standard deviation were used in reporting the result. This is shown in Table 1 Demographic Information about the Respondents. Table 1 reveals that there were slightly more female respondents (50.5%) than male respondents (49.5%) that participated in the study. There were more married respondents (71.6%) than the single respondents (28.6%). A majority of the respondents (40.7%) were within the age bracket of 31 -40 years. Although respondents with working experience of 1 -10 years (74.7%) were in the majority, all the respondents with working experience of 1 -10 years (74.7%), 11 -20 years (11.0%), 31 -40 years (6.6%), 21 -30 years (5.5%) respectively have the ability to respond to effect of training and motivation positively. More than half of the respondents (55.0%) have Bachelor's degree (or its equivalent) and above.
Research Question 1: Is training given to library personnel in the University of Lagos? Table 2 reveals that respondents agree that training is given to library personnel in the University, with the response rate of ""Yes"" (79.1%) as the highest and ""No"" (20.9%) with the lowest.
Research Question 2: What type(s) of training is mostly given to the library personnel in the University of Lagos?
Table 3 shows the type of training mostly given to the library personnel in the University of Lagos. In total, there were 7 questions that were used to describe the types of training given to library personnel in the University of Lagos, and amidst all, library personnel in the University received training mostly through workshops, job rotation, self-instruction and computer based training.
Research Question 3: What type of training is needed by the library personnel in University of Lagos? Table 4 shows the type of training needed by the library personnel in University of Lagos. According to the table, the most needed type of training was conference attendance (M = 3.41), followed by workshops (M = 3.18), and computer based training (M = 3.13). The least required training was coaching (M = 2.51). Thus, Table 4    fered in the library, to some extent (47.3%) and the least is Not at all (7.7%). This finding indicates that training given to library personnel in University of Lagos does actually help them to put in their best in their jobs, though, to some extent. Perhaps this is the reason Iqbal, Nabi, Munner and Anuar contend that training outputs ought to emphasize performance, not just learning which the employee's expectation from training is [24].
Research Question 6: What is the perceived impact of training and motivation on job performance of library personnel in the University of Lagos?
According to Table 7, training helps library personnel to be more creative in their line of work (M = 3.59) ranking the highest. This is followed by responding to needs and feelings of different people in difficult situation (M = 3.47) and so on. The result indicates that training equips library personnel skillfully and psychologically. This finding is supported by Stueart and Moran who affirmed that training influences the arousal, direction, and maintenance of behaviours relevant to work setting [18].
Research Question 7: How is the library personnel in university of Lagos assessed?
In Table 8, performance measures of library personnel in University of Lagos indicate that they were more punctual at work (M = 4.57), while leadership quality (M = 4.20) and quality of work output (M = 4.20) followed. Problem solution ability ranked least (M = 3.85). Nevertheless, it is significant to point out that the mean scores of all ten performance factors measured were above 3.50 (M > 3.50), indicating that on the overall, the performance of the library personnel in the University is above average.  
Conclusion
Training works with motivation and without the library personnel being motivated, the tasks and jobs would not be carried out effectively. Hence training of library personnel helps to increase productivity, increase employee morale, availability of skilled workforce, reduce supervision, bring personal growth, and many more. Therefore, library personnel must be motivated to perform well in their jobs by giving them regular training programs that relate to their individual work activities as this will translate in their job output not as individual workers but to the benefit of the organization as well.",2869,3162

Machara and Jain (2016) defined the phrase motivation as ""motivation refers to the drivers that stimulate our desire to do things or act in a certain way."" Motivation is a managerial tool used to motivate people to improve work performance; it is an internal force to achieve set goals (Boddy, 2008). Motivation is to do work that may be the best possible effort employed by a person to accomplish assigned work (Gomez-Mejia, Balkin & Cardy, 2015). Beach (1985) defined motivation as the best use of energy to attain a goal or reward. Terry (2005) is narrated as driving force in people for doing some-things or achieving set objectives. Ugah (2008) divided motivation theories into two main classes: content theories and process theories.\nMotivation is the behavioral change to drive people to execute organizational goals (Saka & Salman, 2014). It is appraised as an effort exerts on work to accomplish a task (Lawson, 2018). Chandrasekar (2011) also agreed that the personal motivation of workers maximizes work productivity in the workplace. Cited by (Lawson, 2018) Tiwari (2015) stipulates, motivation figures the management of an organization and energizes employees simultaneously. The motivation is considered as vital tool to improve employees\' workplace performance (Johns & Saks, 2008).\nMotivation is a good indicator for better library workplace performance and productivity (Yaya, Uzohue & Akintayo, 2016;Antwi & Bello, 1993;Ugah, 2008;Saka & Salman, 2014;Kunle, Aduku, & Ismail, 2015;Bamgbose & Ladipo, 2017;Tella, Ayeni & Popoola, 2007). Al-Aufi and Ahmed (2014) opined that library managers need to consider the effectiveness of employee motivation on work quality output and a healthier attitude to productivity. Tella, Ayeni, and Popoola (2007) discoursed that financial incentives help library managers to escalate library staff\'s working behavior toward workplace success. Ugah (2008) proposed job motivation strategies for library staff as job enrichment, merit pay, and flexible working hours. He opined motivation as an essential element to improve an individual\'s work performance.\nMaslow\'s motivation theory\nThe well-known motivation theory is perhaps Abraham H. Maslow\'s hierarchy of needs theory (1954). According to Maslow, in every human being, there are five types of requirements: social needs, safety needs, self-esteem, and self-actualization. According to this hierarchy of needs, unmet needs demotivate individuals. These five needs are grouped into two categories, one is basic needs, like security, physiological, love, and esteem, and the second is needs of growth such as self-actualization. (Maslow, 1954) Deficiency of basic needs is said to demotivate people when they are unsatisfied. Psychological needs are considered major ones as compared to others. Furthermore, the need to satisfy such needs will grow stronger the longer the duration is denied. The longer a person goes without eating, the hungrier they will be. One must meet lower-level basic needs before moving forward to meet higher-level growth needs. Once these needs have been reasonably satisfied, one can reach the highest level, called self-actualization. Biological and physiological conditions are exemplary as air, food, drink, shelter, warmth, sex, and sleep. Second is safety needs -protection from elements, order, security, law, limits, stability, and freedom from fear. The third one is belongingness/love or Social Needs -belongingness, affection, and love, from workgroup, family, friends, and romantic relationships. At fourth number is esteem needsmastery, achievement, independence, status, dominance, prestige, self-respect, and others\' respect. The last one is self-actualization needs -realizing personal potential, seeking personal, selffulfillment, growth, and peak experiences.\nThe five-stage model of Maslow\'s hierarchy of needs (1943,1954) was extended in the 1960s and 1970s to eight stages, physiological, safety, social, esteem, cognitive, aesthetic, selfactualization, transcendence needs.\nLiterature review\n\nWork motivation relationship with workplace productivity\nTo explain the relationship between motivation and productivity, extensive studies (Wright, 2001;Lamptey, Boateng & Antwi, 2013;Said et al., 2015;Yaya, Uzohue & Akintayo, 2016) have used most famous theorist Abraham H. Maslow\'s Theory of Needs Hierarchy. This theory is named ""A theory of human motivation"" by Maslow (1954). The psychologist Maslow developed a five-step theory and explained that people are motivated by satisfying these five needs. Researchers in extensive literature (Ugah, 2008;Lamptey, Boateng & Antwi, 2013;Said et al., 2015;Yaya, Uzohue & Akintayo, 2016) stated an organization meets needs of employees ultimately increases work productivity. Arshadi (2010) conducted a study to examine the relationship between autonomy support, work motivation, need satisfaction, and job performance. The industry employees were the population of this study, from which the sample size is driven using a stratified sampling technique. Data was collected through a questionnaire; the study found a positive relationship between autonomy supports and need satisfaction. Further, need satisfaction has a positive influence on work motivation and job performance. The author recommended that institutions and universities organize training and development programs to sharpen employees\' technical and soft skills. Chandrasekar (2011) adopted quantitative research method to analyze the relationship between workplace environment and work productivity. Questionnaires circulated to 285 employees selected as respondents for study using a stratified random sampling technique.\nCommented study results, factors such as workplace environment, work performance feedback, motivation, mentoring or coaching, and relationship building positively affect organization work performance. These factors extend the level of collaboration, innovation, and job satisfaction among employees. Yaya, Uzohue, and Akintayo (2016) scrutinized correlational analysis between employee motivation and librarians\' productivity in Nigeria\'s public universities. Researchers developed a questionnaire as a data collection tool, filled by the librarians selected as sample size via random sampling technique. The study concluded employee motivation is correlated with job satisfaction and work productivity. As advised based on findings, the increase of employee job motivation level escalation works productivity capability. Al-Aufi and Ahmed (2014) assessed the level of motivation of academic library employees; they selected 29 academic libraries and chose 111 library staff members for data collection. This study is quantitative by nature. Initial data was collected through a questionnaire developed based on Maslow\'s hierarchy of needs (1954).\nFindings of the study revealed that motivation level was modest and the level of satisfaction was low. There is a need to solve issues related to security, health insurance, and housing loans. Saka and Salman (2014) scanned the level of job motivation, satisfaction, and performance of librarians working in Nigeria\'s public and private universities. Researchers found a high level of job performance as compared to motivation and satisfaction. Yaya (2017) scrutinized the effects of human capital development, job motivation and emotional intelligence on the Nigeriens\' public sector university librarians\' job satisfaction and work productivity. A questionnaire was developed as a data collection instrument filled by the sample respondents was driven from the target population using a random sampling technique. Findings revealed that selected three elements, human capital development, job motivation, and emotional intelligence, have dominant effects on librarians\' job satisfaction and work productivity. The study advocated that universities\' management should play an efficient role in developing and polishing librarians\' soft skills. Machara and Jain (2016) sought study results that public library staff in Botswana is demotivated and dissatisfied. The factors caused by demotivation enlisted as workplace working environment, job security, job-related rules and regulations, coworkers\' or supervisors\' working behaviors, and professional development and promotions opportunities. Antwi and Bello (1993) evaluated academic libraries\' motivation and productivity, used the survey research method, and gathered data through questionnaires filled by the library staff members. The study found that library staff is motivated to do the work. Still, some factors demotivate the workers, like lack of professional development opportunities and promotion to the next high step. These types of characteristics have substantial effects on the motivation level of work and ultimately affect workplace production. Lawson (2018) conducted a thesis to evaluate employee motivation and job satisfaction relation with work productivity. A cross-sectional study data were collected through a questionnaire filled by 184 staff members of Sam Jonah and Osagyefo\'s libraries in Ghana. The study found motivational factors to job satisfaction which ultimately cause higher libraries\' workplace productivity. The highlighted determinants are salary, policies, interpersonal relations, working environment and supervision. Through these, they can streamline employees\' concentrations toward the accomplishment of workplace goals. Kunle, Aduku, and Ismail (2015) evaluated the motivation level and work performance of the para-professional staff of tertiary institution\'s libraries of Kaduna State. Initial data were collected through structured questionnaires and interviews from the selected respondents using a stratified random sampling technique. Descriptive and inferential statistical tests are applied to test hypotheses. The study concluded there were so many strategies used to motivate libraries\' para-professional staff members, such as salaries, loans, promotion, job enrichment, development training, and education. The findings indicated a significant positive relationship between job motivation and para-professional staff members\' work performance. The study strongly emphasized that employee motivation plays a significant role in boosting work output, so it is recommended that library managers continue to motivate using various strategies.\nSenyah (2003) conducted a study entitled ""Motivation and Productivity in Academic\nLibraries: A Case Study of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology Library, Kumasi"". The author indicated that library assistants, composed of para-professionals (senior and junior staff), make up over 50% of the KNUST Library\'s total work. Employee motivation is a strong element in motivating them towards the efficient and effective operation of the University Library System. Higher motivation recommendations are finally proffered to boost staff performance and delivery of service at the KNUST Library. The study also revealed some factors precluding motivation of the assistants. Bamgbose and Ladipo (2017) examined the influence of the Nigerian academic library employees\' work motivation on their work performance and productivity. Using the survey research method, data was gathered through a Motivation Employees Performance and Productivity (MEPP) questionnaire filled by selected library staff members. Researchers received back 266 filled questionnaires, as a total of 322 were circulated. The results of this study highlighted some dominant motivational factors, i.e., job security, healthy work environment, staff appraisal, salary, rewards and other financial enticements, which influenced work performance and productivity of library employees.\nResearchers opined motivational determinants drive workers\' spirits for better work performance. Employee motivation has a significant impact on workplace productivity that is ultimately the success of an organization.\nStatement of the problem\nIn various studies (Ugah, 2008;Chandrasekar, 2011;Wright, 2001;Lamptey, Boateng & Antwi, 2013;Said et al., 2015;Yaya, Uzohue & Akintayo, 2016;Bamgbose & Ladipo, 2017;Senyah, 2003;Kunle, Aduku & Ismail, 2015;Lawson, 2018) researchers proved that work motivation of employees has substantial effects on the job performance. Researchers have produced tremendous literature to dig out such type of problems at the international level, but few studies carried out at the local level in Pakistan. Specifically in librarianship found a literature gap, so to fill this gap and to answer this issue, the present study was done. \nResearch questions of the study\n\nResearch methodology\nTo carry out this study, quantitative research approach was used, which considers the best approach by Creswell (2014) to analyze the relationship between the variables. The survey method adopted for data collection, a self-designed questionnaire was developed based on the available literature, specifically Maslow\'s theory.\nDevelopment of the questionnaire\nWith the help of relevant literature (Bamgbose & Ladipo, 2017;Senyah, 2003;Kunle, Aduku & Ismail, 2015;Lawson, 2018;Antwi & Bello, 1993 To validate questionnaire, a pilot study was carried out to check the reliability, and responses collected from the library professionals who were part of the study population.\nThrough follow-up, researchers got responses with suggestions. Minor changes were made and Statistical Product Service Solution (SPSS) was used to yield Cronbach\'s alpha value by applying the statistics test. Spector (1992) recommended an acceptable value at least 0.70 for a reliable questionnaire. Cronbach\'s alpha coefficient obtained for work motivation employed at the workplace (n = 20, Î± = 0.963) and for effects on workplace productivity (n = 26, Î± = 0.964).\nThe instrument was reliable because the value obtained is above the minimum accepted value 0.70.\nRespondents\nThe library professionals worked in central libraries of universities and Degree Awarding \nData collection\nThe web version of the data collection tool administered to library professionals by electronic mail along with a cover letter, various mailing groups like Pakistan Library Automation Group (PakLag), Pakistan Library Club (PLC), Pakistan Librarians Welfare Organisation (PLWO), and personal email addresses used for this purpose. URL of the online questionnaire shared with targeted respondents via different social media modes such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Short Message Service (SMS), and Instant Messaging (IM). Printed questionnaires sent through courier to library professionals to fill and send back the questionnaires. The researcher personally visited the institutions and got filled printed questionnaires by hand from the respondents. After fifteen to twenty days, only 50% of respondents sent back filled questionnaires. Researchers used various methods or tools to get a high response rate; therefore, they obtained a reasonable response rate of 83% due to the extreme efforts.\nData analysis of the study\n\nDemographic information of the respondents\nTwo hundred eighty-seven questionnaires were administered to the library professionals working in central libraries of the universities and higher education institutions of Punjab and Islamabad city the capital of Pakistan. 239 (83%) respondents consisted on 162 (67.8%) male and 77 (32.2%) female filled questionnaires. In this study, a high response rate was received from male library professionals\' side. The following demographic information was gathered from the respondents regarding their highest academic qualification. No, any respondent belongs to the BLIS/Diploma-LIS group, the highest 168 (70.3%) number of respondents have 16 years of qualification as MLIS/BS-LIS, MPhil-LIS 66 (27.6%) and PhD-LIS 5 (2.1%) respondents have their highest professionals\' qualification. Found professionally experienced respondents in our cohort 75 (31.4%) have 16 years and above work experience, 80 (33.5%) fall in group 11-15 years. 66 (27.6%) respondents have experience 6-10 years, and only 18 (7.5%) newly entered in professional life fall in category 1-5 years of work experiences. The respondents of this study have a variety of designations 23 (9.6%) were working as Chief Librarians in different organizations, 35 (14.6%) belong to title Deputy Librarians and mostly fall in group Librarians 122 (51%), and 59 (24.7%) belonged with designations Assistant Librarian. 144 (60.3%) respondents were from public institutions, and 95 (39.7%) associated with private institutions.\nThe response rate received from public institutions was high than in private institutions. \nLevel of work motivation of university library professionals\nTo peruse work motivation of library professionals, gathered data through questionnaires and requested the respondents to indicate their motivation level on a five point Likert-type scale from very low to very high. This section comprised of twenty statements which were grouped into five types of needs, physiological needs, security/safety needs, social needs, esteem needs and self-actualization. The descriptive analysis of library professionals\' levels of motivation ranked in descending order according to the mean values as showed in \nPerceptions of library professionals regarding the effectiveness of motivation\n\nResults of t-test\nTo investigate whether or not a statistically significant difference exists among perceptions of library professionals regarding the effects of work motivation on their work production based on gender and type of institutions. So the independent sample t-test was run on the cumulative mean scores. The results of test as shown in the Table 3, indicated that there was no significant difference in the mean scores of males (M=3.88, SD=.55) and females (M=3.91, SD=0.68); t (237) = -.342, p = .733. It denotes there was no significant difference existed in this regard. The statistics indicated in Table 3, respondents belong to public institutions (M=3.84, SD=.56) and private (M=3.95, SD=.63); t (237) = -1.416, p = .158 there is no significant differences existed. The library professionals from public and private institutions had the same perceptions regarding the effectiveness of work motivation on their work productivity. \nResults of ANOVA test\nTo examine whether or not a statistically significant difference exists among the perceptions of the respondents regarding the effectiveness of work motivation on their work productivity based on their designations, qualification and work experiences. One way ANOVA was run on cumulative mean scores the results extracted from the tests are as, for library professionals designations (F = 2.459, p = .064), qualifications (F = .170, p = .844), and for work experiences (F = .978, p = .404). The results confirmed that one-way ANOVA determined no statistically significant difference between groups, so library professionals had the same perceptions regarding the effectiveness of work motivation on their work production. \nCorrelation analysis between work motivation and work productivity\nThe correlation of coefficient attained was .425 with a p-value < 0.05. The result showed a positive correlation between the variables motivation and work productivity of universities and DAIs\' library professionals as indicated in the Table 5 as (r = .425, N = 239, p = .000). The null hypothesis is rejected, because results show a significant relationship between work motivation and librarians\' work productivity. \nDiscussion\nThe findings of this study confirmed that library professionals perceived them proficient in work motivation. All of the competency statements had a mean score above and close to 4.00, which is considered a high-level average score. However, out of 20 skill statements, 10 got a mean score above 4.00, 2 are down with 0.1 and 6, and slightly below. These results are constant with previous study (Alajmi, & Alasousi, 2019). The present study results proven by applying Pearson Correlation tests, work motivation of university and DAIs\' library professionals have significant effects on their workplaces\' productivity. Extensive studies demonstrated motivation as a good indicator for better performance and productivity in the library workplace (Yaya, Uzohue & Akintayo, 2016;Antwi & Bello, 1993;Ugah, 2008;Saka & Salman, 2014;Kunle, Aduku, & Ismail, 2015;Bamgbose & Ladipo, 2017;Tella, Ayeni & Popoola, 2007). If an organization wants more production, it must take a keen interest in identifying and moving forward to meet the different types of workers\' needs, i.e., physiological, security/safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization (Alajmi, & Alasousi, 2019). Bamgbose and Ladipo (2017) \nFindings\n\nRQ1. What is the level of work motivation of university library professionals?\nBy applied descriptive statistical tests found that library professionals have a high level of work motivation. They were perceived as proficient in work motivation.\nRQ2. Does the work motivation of university library professionals have effects on their work productivity?\nYes, it was statistically proved that the work motivation of university library professionals has significant effects on their work productivity. Therefore, the study came up with findings that work motivation of employees energizes them to apply all their efforts to achieve the assigned workplace goals. The present study concluded that if employers want more production in the workplace, they need to pay attentions to the motivational triggers of their employees. Without motivated employees, organizations may not meet their goals and ultimately lead to the failure of organizations.\nDelimitations of the study\nRegardless of the implications of this study, it is prone to some limitations. The present study delimited to the library professionals were working in central libraries of Higher Education Commission (HEC) recognized universities and Degree Awarding Institutes (DAIs) in Punjab and Islamabad were the population of this study. According to the HEC total number of recognized universities and DAIs was 92. The universities and DAIs of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Balochistan, Gilgit-Biltistan, and Azad Jammu Kashmir were excluded from the study.\nFuture directions\nThe present study focused on library professionals and future researchers can replicate the same study in any other sector. In the existing study, the relation was checked between work motivation and work productivity of library professionals, future researchers should also consider other independent variables such as emotional intelligence, communication, stress management, leadership etc. and dependent variables like employee satisfaction and employee performance. This study applied a quantitative research approach and employed a survey research method, while in future studies, researchers can use qualitative or mixed-method.",4668,5402

",2017,Journal of Library Philosophy and Practice,,"Introduction
In most organizations, the craving to achieve optimal efficiency in productivity is central to managerial objectives. Organizational effectiveness is largely determined by the quality of the employees. Therefore, the most daunting task of a manager is how best to put together human and materials resources to achieve the organizational mission, vision and objectives (Nnaeto & Ndoh, 2018). Motivation serves as a tool, which prompts staff to voluntarily commit themselves to follow specific courses laid out to achieve a projected organizational goal so that efforts made will lead to achieving some individual goals. Cherry (2015) defined motivation as a process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviour, essentially concerned with factors that propel human action or inaction over a certain period. Therefore, motivation is impelling people to do something in return for a reward or award; getting people to move in a certain direction to achieve desired results, encourage employees to seriously work (Hussain & Soroya, 2017).
The relationship between library staff and management is governed by what motivates them to work, and the satisfaction they derive, as management needs to elicit the cooperation of staff and direct their performance to achieve the organizational objectives. The willingness of staff to give their absolute best in this regard is affected by motivation in its ramifications. Job satisfaction as noted by Babalola and Nwalo (2013) enhances workers' productivity, especially in academic libraries as a job satisfied worker is a happy and productive worker. When a library staff experiences a drop in job satisfaction, it leads to poor performance; especially when employers make available tools required to perform the job and reward them handsomely while allowing them to express creativity in their specialities. Their motivation, in a long run, affects their job satisfaction level and performance. Comparing to all other efficient methods on employees' productivity, motivation is the most important and significant (Gobari, Akram, Majid, & Seyed, 2013).
Although many studies have been conducted in the area of leadership styles, motivation and job satisfaction for job performance in different places and among different populations and professionals, little is known about how the identified variables would jointly affect the University of Ilorin staff job satisfaction and performance in particular. Merely extrapolating the results of studies from these other places, circumstances and peculiarities cannot attend adequately to the research gap that the absence of a study in this area at the University of Ilorin has created; thereby compelling research attention such as the present one.
It is envisaged that the study's findings would be useful to the University of Ilorin Management, administrators and staff of the Library; because it sought to investigate how the staff will react to motivational techniques initiated by the management and how it affects their job satisfaction and performance. The findings will help Library management see what satisfies and dissatisfies staff; hence their performance.
Much had been written on the effects of motivation on staff performance and satisfaction. In a higher institution environment, the library is a major information-providing system supporting teaching, learning and research (Anunobi & Edoka, 2010). Similarly, Liao (2012) defined job performance as standard for advancements, redundancy, rewards, punishments, reviews and salary changes, it also satisfies the needs for employees to realize themselves, and argued that employee performance symbolises the broad belief of the personnel about their behaviour and contributions to the organization's achievement.
According to Pawirosumarto, Sarjana and Muchtar (2017), employee performance depends upon factors like performance appraisals, employee inspiration, employee contentment, payments, guidance and improvement, job safety, and business configuration. Kaba (2017) viewed freedom as instinctive while going for their favoured solution to a challenge serves as an important factor constituting job performance. Hence, employees must not be over instructed and must be afforded the flexibility to improve their performance. Khoreva and Wechtler (2018) argued that employees' performance is determined by how creative and flexible they are, in difficult situations, when they do not have laid down instruction and directions to follow. Nawoselng'ollan, and Roussel (2017) noted that leadership style, which influences performance positively is an important factor for enhancing the performance of workers' happiness on their jobs. Kaluarachchi and Gamlath (2014) viewed job satisfaction as the rate at which employees like or dislike their work and the extent to which their expectations concerning work have been fulfilled. Job satisfaction is generally acknowledged as a necessary ingredient for personal fulfilment in carrying out one's duties. From the literature reviewed, related studies were conducted with different focus and demography from specific variables, focus and demography of this present study. This identified gap thus constitute the concern and focus of the present study, thereby justifying its conduct.
Although findings by Octavinnah, Pandjaitan and Kuswanto ( 2017) showed that the level of job satisfaction and productivity of library personnel is low, results from Adeeko, Aboyade and Oyewole (2017) however, indicated that their research productivity is relatively high. Ademodi and Akintomide (2017) asserted that the common challenges preventing organizations from achieving high performance and job satisfaction include low salaries, irregular promotional structure, non-recognition of workers' achievements, poor condition of service, inadequate remuneration, poor working environment, and inadequate working materials. Academic libraries in Nigeria cannot be isolated from these ugly phenomena as observations showed that their level of productivity is low due to personnel job dissatisfaction. The inherent challenge identified is that many employers have attempted several programs to motivate their employees, yet they have not worked for every category of staff in the library. Thus, the study's broad objective was to examine the effects of motivation on job satisfaction and library staff performance in the University of Ilorin Library, Kwara State, Nigeria. Therefore, the study sets out to provide the answer to the main research question namely; what are the factors that constitute the job performance of librarians in the University of Ilorin Library?
Methods
This study adopted the survey research design, which was aimed at investigating the effects of motivation on staff performance and job satisfaction in the University of Ilorin Library. According to Fisher (2007), a survey research design is a type of design that involves a systematic and comprehensive collection of information about the opinions, attitudes, feelings, beliefs and behaviours of people through observation, interview and administering of the questionnaire. Since the focus of the study is to seek the opinions and perspectives of the research subjects on how motivation affects their job performance and job satisfaction, the survey research design is thus considered as an appropriate design for the current study. The population of the study was 46, and this was made up of 21 professional and 25 paraprofessional staff members of the library, as at the time of the Study.
The questionnaire was validated by two experts in Library and Information Science, who determined the appropriateness of its content against the purpose of the study. Data were collected by the researchers after obtaining prior permission from the concerned authority and the study subjects, the confidentiality of data was maintained. The questionnaire was administered to the respondents on a one-on-one by the researcher, the questionnaire was retrieved after 3 days of administration which allowed the correspondent to fill in the required data within a fair period. The 46 copies of the questionnaire were administered personally by the researchers, out of which 41 copies, representing 89.1% were completed, returned and eventually found usable for the analysis. Descriptive statistics was employed for data analysis, by which answers were provided to the research questions, using the tabular presentation of frequency counts and percentages.
Results and Discussions
This segment presents the analysis of the data collected for the study using the questionnaire. The basis for the analysis presented in this segment was the 41 copies of the completed and returned questionnaire out of the total number administered in the first instance. The high return rate of 89.1%, which was achieved in this particular regard can only be attributed to the strategy employed in personally administering the copies of the questionnaire by the researchers and staying back to ensure, not only that they were completed alone, but more importantly, that they were correctly completed by the respondents. Attaining a very high return rate as done in this study was of paramount importance, given the fact that the study adopted the total enumeration technique of sampling because the population was of a small, and therefore manageable size The analysis thus began with the demographic distribution of the respondents, as contained in Table 1.  Table 1 reveals that the majority (51.2%) of the respondents were female and then the male (48.8%), implying the dominance of the female gender among the respondents across the two categories of the Library staff. On the respondents' age categorization, the majority of them (39.0%) fall in the range of 35 and 45, with those in the range of 46-55 as well as 56 years and above, having the least representation. Those in the 18-25 years of age, 26-34 years of age as well as those in the bracket age of 35-45 also accounted for 25.4%, 22.0% and 39.0% responses respectively. Similarly, the majority (75.6%) of the respondents were found to have been married, with only 24.4% of them being single, but without any being separated or divorced. These results on age and marital status could imply maturity among the study's respondents, which can serve as a good indicator for the quality of responses they are likely to be given. On the respondents' qualifications, the Bachelor of Library Science (BLS) degree, the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree, and the Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) in Library and Information Science degrees are the highest education qualifications indicated by many of the respondents (68.3%), while the least comprised of those possessing the Post Graduate Degree in Library Science or Library and Information Science (2.4%). Out of them, 17.1% had either the Master of Science (Library and Information Science), Master of Library and Information Science or Master of Education (Library and Information Science Degree); apart from that 4.9%, who possess the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in Library and Information Science.
This can simply be interpreted to mean that the respondents in this study had, to a very large extent, the requisite qualifications of the workforce in a typical academic library, which can also have a far-reaching implication on their job performance, one way or the other. Thus, the spread of the qualifications possessed by the respondents is, to say the least, indicative of the fact that the academic workforce in the Library studied was composed of men and women who are of the 'best fit' given the qualifications needed to perform both their professional and even the paraprofessional duties as required by the callings of their jobs. In terms of years of experience of the respondents, the majority (34.1%) of them had less than 5 years of working experience being at one end of the spectrum as against the other end which indicated that there were no respondents who had job experience of 21-25-year range, implying a rather low-level experience among them. Other responses which are also of some degree of significance include those of the working year experience of 5-10 years (26.8%), 11-15 years (22.0%), 16-20 years and 31-35 years (2.4%) each, as well as those in the age bracket of 26-30 years accounting for 12.2% response. These responses on the distribution of the respondents in line with their years of working experience were also reflective of the good spread, which in itself, has its contribution towards the effective performance of assigned duties and responsibilities by the staff members in the Library. Note: SA+A = Agree; D+SD = Disagree
Table 2 shows that all the respondents agreed that the quality of their assigned work can serve as a criterion for judging their performance while 35 (85.36%) respondents agreed that the quantity of work they performed can also serve the same purpose. Also, 40 (97.56%) of them agreed that their job performance can be determined if the work assigned to them is completed on time, and agreed too, that when they perform their work with accuracy, they have recorded a good performance. These responses presented the respondents' opinion as to what constituted their job performance. Thus, many of the respondents agreed that they are performing well when they can follow instructions and directions. This implies that most of the respondents in the Library studied considered performing their tasks with very high precision as an important performance determinant, aside from other factors such as timely and accurate completion of tasks as well as their ability to follow instructions and directions . Note: SA+A = Agree; D+SD = Disagree Table 3 reveals that all the respondents agreed that if they are satisfied with their job, it will make them perform better, implying that happy librarians will be productive. Furthermore, 23 (56.09%) of them agreed that satisfaction with their job has no relationship with their job performance while a few of them, however, disagreed with this position. Some 35 (85.36%) of them agreed that their job performance will determine their level of satisfaction, just as another 22 (53.65%) indicated that they will be more productive if they are in a different job. This means that the Library staff members believed that their occupation prevents them from working at their full capacity. This may therefore imply that the happiness and satisfaction of the Library staff about their job may likely encourage them to promote a good-natured mood. This was evidenced in the result, which showed that 38 (92.68%) of the respondents agreed that if they can attain satisfaction in the performance of their job, they would have contributed to a pleasant atmosphere within the Library.  Table 4 reveals that 37 (90.24%) of the respondents agreed that the feeling of being involved at work usually affect their job performance, which reveals that most of the library staff considered transparency and openness from the library management as important factors that may affect their job performance. The respondents are interested in being assured of keeping their job as most of them agreed that the feeling of high job security affects their performance. Likewise, 33 (80.48%) of the respondents agreed that receiving sufficient financial reward affects their performance, thereby presenting the high premium that the Library staff placed on monetary reward. This response may imply that the library staff members need to enjoy their work for good performance, as revealed by the 37 (90.24%) of the respondents, who agreed that the enjoyment they derive from their work affects their performance. Another 36 (87.80%) of the respondents agreed that having the chance at a job promotion and career development affects their performance, just as the majority of others (90.24%) indicated that good working conditions affect their performance. Note: SA+A = Agree; D+SD = Disagree Table 5 reveals that the majority of the respondents (95.12%) agreed that they are happy with the job that they perform as librarians, even as 19 (46.34%) of them indicated that they will be happier doing another job aside from the current one that they do. What this points to is the fact that that most of the respondents are happy with their job but they think they will derive even more happiness in another occupation other than the current one that they engage in. Furthermore, 37 (90.24%) of the respondents agreed that their job gives them pleasure while 34 (82.92%) others indicated that they are willing to encourage others to come into their profession probably due to the happiness that they derive from what they are presently doing in the profession. In addition to this, 30 (73.17%) indicated that if they are to make a choice all over, they will choose to remain in this job until they retire from the service, while only 11 (26.82%) indicated that they would rather take their shot at another job, occupation or profession, if they had the chance to do that, probably owing to the current experiences that they are undergoing in their present calling. This implies that the majority of the respondents believe that they are well satisfied with their present job as librarians, a factor, which is capable of enhancing better job performance by the staff of the Library, thereby leading to greater productivity in the performance of the jobs they do.  6 reveals that 37 (90.24%) of the respondents indicated that their job satisfaction and job performance level can be enhanced if allowed to participate in decision making. Furthermore, most of them tied their job satisfaction and job performance enhancement to regular promotion, salary increment, training opportunity, well-set library goals, sincere annual appraisal and concrete job description. This is, however, not to downplay the other responses given by the respondents along the line, which include incremental in their salary, opportunity for training, conducive working environment, the existence of well-set goals, sincerity in the conduct of the annual staff appraisal, availability of concrete job description as well as regular promotion opportunity on a steady basis. Considering the diverse nature of the responses given on this, there is an indication of the need for a variety of incentives in encouraging the staff to satisfactory job performance in the Library.
Findings from the study showed that all the respondents believed that their job performance can be enhanced when the job they perform is of high quality and when the quantity of work is high, when the assigned work is completed on time, and when they perform their work with accuracy. This is in line with the findings of Nwokike and Unegbu (2019), which found that the level of the job performance of librarians in universities in South-East, Nigeria was high. However, this is unlike the findings from such studies as  Amusa, Iyoro and Ajani (2013), and Oyewole and Popoola (2011) that placed the level of the job performance of librarians at a moderate level as the belief is indicative of the fact that job satisfaction and productivity of librarians in public university libraries in Nigeria were low. The study's findings also revealed that the library staff believe their performance can be judged by how well they able to follow instructions and directions. The finding is in line with those of Khoreva and Wechtler (2018) whose research findings indicate that not only did the physical and social employee well-being serve as a moderate mediator of the association between skill-and opportunity-enhancing HR practices and in-role job performance, but indeed, the psychological employee well-being partially mediates the association between motivation-enhancing HR practices and innovative job performance.
This supports the study of Nnaeto and Ndoh (2018) and Idiegbeyan-Ose, Aregbesola, and Owolabi ( 2019) that organisational performance relies on effectiveness and efficiency, while organizational performance depends on how effective and efficient the performance of employees in the organization are. It was also discovered that library staff believe their performance can be judged by how well they can follow instructions and directions, this supports the findings of Pang and Lu (2018) as well as Khoreva and Wechtler (2018).
On the influence of job satisfaction on performance, the majority of the respondents agreed that job satisfaction translates into better job performance; thus showing a relationship between job satisfaction and job performance. This finding is in line with that of Yaya, Opeke and Onuoha (2016), whose study's findings revealed a significant relationship between job satisfaction and productivity of librarians in public university libraries in Nigeria and upon which it concluded that contrary to general belief, job satisfaction and productivity levels of librarians in university libraries were high. This was a confirmation of the assertion that job satisfaction enhances the job productivity of workers in any academic library because a job satisfied librarian is a happy and productive librarian. This finding, in itself, is also significant against the backdrop of the widely-held position by the researchers that employees' job satisfaction is not only central but indeed, critical in determining their overall productivity in the academic libraries, just as it is for any other organization.
It was based on these findings that the study recommended that the management of the university library should embark on a continuous promotion of such values as improved recognition of the library staff, exhibiting good leadership style and deliberate policy towards improving their staff development programmes to increase employee's job satisfaction and their productivity. Similarly, it is also related to the assertion of Azar and Shafighi (2013), who asserted that working atmosphere, leadership, team and co-worker relationship, training and career development, reward programme, guidelines and procedures and workstation wellbeing as well as employee engagement are major factors that determine employee performance.
In addition to this is the majority of the respondents disagreed with the postulation that satisfaction with their job has no relationship with their performance. This is contrary to the findings of Octavianna et al. ( 2017), which found a significant correlation between job satisfaction and employee performance. It was also revealed that the performance of staff will determine their level of satisfaction. Thus, the position of Yaya, Opeke and Onuoha (2016) that job satisfaction enhances the productivity of the workers in an academic library as a job satisfied librarian is a happy and productive librarian also did not support this finding.
The findings of this study on the effects of motivational factors on performance are synonymous with the assertion of Nurun et.al (2017), which claimed that motivation factors including the feeling of being involved at work, good working conditions and enjoyment of staff derive from their work, affect their performance. This finding contradicts those of Ikonne and Fajonyomi (2019), which led to the conclusion that motivational factors in Federal university libraries in the northeast, Nigeria, were low. Similarly, Idiegbeyan-Ose, Aregbesola and Owolabi (2019) found that the library staff job satisfaction was low among the library staff in the private universities studied. However, the findings of this study agreed that receiving sufficient financial reward affects the staff's performance, which is supported by the study of Schuck and Rabe-Hemp (2018) that claimed that pay and bonus affect the performance and productivity of workers. The findings also showed that intrinsic job motivation factors like the feeling of being involved at work and receiving sufficient financial reward affect the performance of staff, this is in tandem with the findings of Kaluarachchi, and Gamlath (2014), Sajuyigbe, Olawoye and Adeyemi (2013) as well as Schuck and Rabe-Hemp ( 2018) who all claim that job involvement as well as financial reward affect workers' productivity and most often positively. Lamptey, Boateng and Antwi's (2013) study also relates to the findings of this study that there is a clear relationship between job promotion and career development the performance of staff.
On the extent of job satisfaction among other measurable factors, the majority of the staff agreed that they are happy with their job as librarians particularly when their jobs gave them pleasure. This finding aligns with those of Okolocha, Akam, and Uchehara (2021), which found that responsibility and career advancement had a positive significant effect on the job performance of the academic staff of public universities in Southeast, Nigeria. The findings are also in line with those of Lamptey et al. (2013), Ajie and Omotunde (2015), Katamba and Abdulsalam (2014) as well as that of Chijioke (2011), where they found that majority of the librarians are generally satisfied with their job, and further buttressed the position by stating that they will not be satisfied doing another job because their work gives them pleasure. Again, Yaya (2019) in a study on job satisfaction among librarians in Nigerian public universities, found that there was a high level of job satisfaction among librarians in public university libraries in Nigeria. The study concluded that contrary to the general belief of low level of job satisfaction among librarians in university libraries it was however discovered that it was high.
In addition, the finding also finds a high degree of relevance in the study by Ogunbanjo (2021), which reported the existence of job satisfaction among the library staff in public tertiary institution libraries in Ogun State, Nigeria, where it was affirmed that the librarians had a high degree of job satisfaction and organisational commitment with co-workers, supervision, salary, and opportunities for promotion. The result of a test of the relationship between job satisfaction and organisational commitment was found to be positive, and thus recommended proactive measures in increased salary, more opportunity for promotion, internetworking equipment and the preparedness of the library staff members in the public tertiary institution libraries in Ogun State, Nigeria, to ensure their job satisfaction and organisational commitment. This is also not too different from the outcome of the study by Hyder and Batool (2013), which led to the conclusion that job satisfaction is significantly associated with the nature of work, fair treatment, co-workers and status of librarians in society. In the study conducted by Kabaka, Şena, Göçera, Küçüksöylemez and Tuncer (2014), results showed that staff training and education, and their relations and teamwork represented the most dominant factors on staff members' job satisfaction. However, factors with little impact in this regard include education and salary levels on job satisfaction whereas such other factors as facilities, job security, rewards were found to have a considerable impact.
On the strategies through which the job satisfaction and job performance of the individuals can be enhanced, the majority of the respondents agreed that the existence of well-set library goals will enhance their job satisfaction and performance of librarians. This finding is similar to those found by Clements and Kamau (2017), in which they concluded that having highly clear and challenging but achievable goals will make employees perform better. Also, this finding finds relevance in those of Lien (2017) which established the fact that staff's feelings as to how fair their pay was are related to their job satisfaction, which formed the basis of the recommendation that the staff should be allowed to select their most preferred fringe benefits, as an important strategy to guarantee and sustain their job satisfaction. This accounted for why there is a rising number of leaders in organizations, who allow their staff members to structure such fringe benefits as medical, dental, and life insurance.
In their study's findings, Chrisman, Devaraj, and Patel (2017) reported that fairness in pay and good compensations strategy have a greater tendency to have a broader impact on job performance, because, those who perceived their pay as not fair enough would tend to compare theirs with those of others simply because they hold the view that such compensation did not reflect their efforts, as represented by their job performance. Similarly, Rassa (2017) on his part, reported that low salary packages, low benefits, lack of supervision, insufficient professional on the job training as well as the lack of professional recognition were some of the more important factors of dissatisfaction on a job, which was the reason for which he recommended that leaders in any kind of organisation must always strive to increase their staff's levels of job satisfaction to obtain higher levels of employee satisfaction and accordingly, ensure high-quality service delivery.
Moreover, a concrete job description and a conducive working environment in this study are important strategies to enhance job satisfaction, and this was supported by the findings of the study conducted by Osabiya (2014). This study also found that, if given the opportunity to participate in decision making, that is a feeling and experience of leadership, when instilled into the library staff members, will experience improved job satisfaction and performance; and this finding is in line with the study of Rukhmani, Ramesh and Jayakrishnan (2010) as well as Hearn, Close, Smith and Southey ( 2011), in which their findings also point in the direction of the strategies with which the job satisfaction and job performance of the individuals can be enhanced in general. This was in line with their respective findings which underscored the need to provide a workable framework for the provision of conducive working conditions for their organisation's workforce towards better performance and job satisfaction as the necessary precondition for attaining the set goals and objectives of the organization.
Conclusion
The findings of this study established that performance and job satisfaction of the library staff depended on motivation because they were found to be satisfied with their job through good job performance when motivated. Therefore, the study concluded that job motivation, especially by creating the feeling of self-belongingness at work, ensuring high job security, receiving sufficient financial incentives, seamless chances for promotion and career development, as well as having good working conditions, would have direct effects on their job satisfaction and performance. Thus, it recommended that the staff be made to always follow instructions and directives, towards ensuring that their work is performed with accuracy, high quality and quantity while also ensuring that their assigned work must be completed on time. They should also be encouraged to shun negative attitude towards the performance of their jobs while striving to give their best towards the Library's goals attainment. Library management should constantly ensure that staff are satisfied with their jobs to enable them to contribute to creating a pleasant atmosphere within the Library for improving staff and organizational productivity.
The library management should improve the job security of the library staff, by improving their working conditions, by giving them a sense of belonging and involvement in the activities of the Library. Library management must provide sufficient financial reward to the staff members, offer them promotion, career development and capacity building programs for the staff as a deliberate policy. Library management should also create an enabling environment such that the workforce finds work interesting and worthy of investing their time and efforts on. Further studies by researchers in the future are suggested to include: The influence of leadership styles and motivation on job performance of library personnel in selected public university libraries in Southern Nigeria, effects of motivation on job performance and job satisfaction on organizational goal attainment in public university libraries in Nigeria and a comparative study of leadership styles and motivation on job performance of library personnel in private and public university libraries in South-west, Nigeria.

Professional development (PD) is a lifetime learning process, which is both universal and individualized. It is a universal requirement of all librarians in order to keep up with the rapid changes in the library field and maintain professionalism. At the same time, it is an individualized experience that varies with the needs of specific work duties as well as resources available around one's working, social, and academic environment. This article discusses the needs (i.e., expansion and diversification of one's functionality) and resources (local and beyond) for PD. Examples of successful PD are drawn from some academic libraries. Administrative support, a very important PD related topic, is also discussed.
",2009,Library Issues,,"I. Introduction
Professional development for academic librarians fulfills a need for the continuing acquisition of knowledge and competencies that has not been met by either formal education or on-the-job-training. This need is driven by both the ""technological imperative"" (the rapid technological change that characterizes contemporary academic libraries), and by the element that librarians share with other professionals, that they are compensated for what they know as well as for what they do. One essential component of the academic librarian's knowledge base is the world of scholarship. The library and information sciences degree does a competent job of preparing librarians for the role of service provider in assisting patrons with the process of completing their scholarship tasks. As individuals, however, librarians may be less well served by formal training for the scholarship demands of their own research and publication, particularly in faculty status settings. Professional development programs work well to foster both specific skill-sets and the more diffuse aspects of process.
While professional development is frequently practice, or task-oriented, it is an equally effective forum for imparting discipline-specific theory, and institutional culture and goals. The core of professional development consists of two elements: the process, and what is achieved via the process, the knowledge and skills pertaining to a given profession. The professional development literature reflects this dual nature, focusing primarily on delivery (process) or content.
Professional development benefits both the individual and the institution. For the individual, the ongoing process of acquiring new information and skills promotes job competencies for performance upgrades and promotion. On the psychological level, heightened competency may reduce job-related stress and increase interest, promoting job satisfaction (Block, 2001). Due to its persistent and lasting nature, professional development is known also as ""life-long learning."" In Chinese, it is the process of 活 到老, 学到老, which means, ""One is never too old to learn"" or ""Keep on learning as long as you live."" An active professional development program offers the institution a corporate strategy for dealing with change (Shaughnessy, 1992). Employee competency and satisfaction underwrite the improvement of library services. This article addresses professional development for academic librarians, with a focus on three issues: needs, resources, and administrative support. Although libraries may vary significantly in their organizational structure, administration, and resources, the general implications and effects of programs on library staff bear great similarity across institutions. The discussion draws examples from practice in some academic libraries.
II. Needs for Professional Development
The perceived needs for professional development may arise in a wide range of situations. For a new librarian, occupational training begins from the moment he/she steps into the profession. Formal classroom instruction covers primarily generalized knowledge about the fundamental concepts and theories of library systems and operations. Each individual library, however, exhibits its own unique identity composed of organizational structure, types and arrangement of information resources, clientele characteristics and needs, and international relations that all form the work place culture. New hires, whether fresh from school with a recent curriculum, or with the advantage of years of practical experience, face the need of becoming familiar with the new institutional identity. Professional development opportunities can help the new librarian put theoretical knowledge into practice, apply generalized concepts to specific responsibilities, and become familiar with given job situations.
Academic librarians are evaluated for their performance in scholarship as well as librarianship, and the requirements of the individual institution and the publishing industry may prompt no small measure of anxiety for new librarians. Where institutions require that librarians pursue successful research and publication in order to achieve promotion and tenure, there is an unofficial consensus that many librarians are ill-prepared¡ ª either by lack of training or release time¡ ª to successfully complete this requirement (Sapon- White, 2004). Programs designed to familiarize librarians with institutional expectations and to de-mystify the writing and submission process can have a positive impact on institutional morale and individual achievement.
By virtue of being in the business of supplying information organization and retrieval services, academic libraries are intimately tied to the constant and rapid technological changes characterizing the information age. This technological imperative penetrates all aspects of the academic library's operations, and drastically influences the information behavior of librarians and patrons alike. The ""push"" factor for establishing an active professional development program is the institution's commitment to and emphasis on the quality and improvement of library services (Shaughnessy, 1992). The push factor for the individual librarian is the expectation and mandate that he or she both maintain expert knowledge of new products and services and at the same time participate in publishing and professional growth activities (Flatley & Weber, 2004).
""Library science"" is so closely related to information technology that the traditional definitions no longer accurately reflect the discipline without incorporating the conceptual element of information technology. Starting from the 1970s and 1980s, the impact of technological advancements have been increasing, changing the reader's habits in accessing and retrieving information. In order to provide better client services, accommodations to, and acquisition of new technology have been made in all library transaction models (operations, service, and communication). The application of new technologies extends to acquisition, cataloging, collection development, circulation (including information sharing), reference (especially virtual reference), information literacy education, information retrieval (databases, including full-text, electronic publishing, and consortial agreements), library services promotion, institutional internal communication, and so on. Thus, all library professionals, regardless of departmental affiliation, face an imperative to upgrade their knowledge, improve their skills, and to adapt and broaden service models. They have no other option if they wish to maintain a role both in the profession and, by extension, in the vitality of the library as an institution.
Chinese American librarians fill a special niche in that they bring to their job, either formally, or informally, their expertise in the Chinese language and culture. Not all academic libraries have a position for a Chinese subject specialist, particularly if the affiliated university does not support a strong program in Chinese studies. This does not, however, exclude the existence of Chinese collections in library holdings, of enrolled Chinese students, and of scholars (both Chinese and non-Chinese) conducting research on China related topics. As a result, many of those not hired as subject specialists nevertheless serve as ""Chinese specialists"" in a greater or lesser capacity, although lacking the official title. Professional development opportunities enable these librarians to fully develop versatile skills in areas outside their official job parameters, in collection development and cataloging of Chinese language materials, for example, or instruction of Chinese students.
III. Resources for Professional Development
Providers and delivery models for professional development resources are as diverse as the potential range of desired content. They run the gamut from formal programs with a big price tag, to informal ""free"" sessions sponsored by one's own department. The primary providers, familiar in the working life of most librarians, are the professional associations [e.g. ALA, CALA (Chinese American Librarians Association)], educational institutions, and private vendors of library products and systems. These are supplemented by the offerings of private firms and consultants that generally focus on specialized short courses (e.g. Synergy Development & Training, LCC for leadership training).
Professional Associations
The conferences and meetings sponsored by professional associations provide a forum not only for learning, but also for professional exchange. Presentations, posters, panel sessions, exhibits--all bring people in the profession together, keeping them abreast of current trends, problems, and solutions. Associations also sponsor single-subject sessions and courses (e.g. ALA's Copyright Seminar, or ACRL's Institute for Information Literacy Immersion).
CALA has in recent years accomplished a great deal in promoting professional development and exchange. The mentorship networking program has established a successful model for occupational consultation for new librarians. On a larger scale, the noteworthy CALA 21st Century Librarians Training Series project, initiated in 2006, has expanded to many provinces in Mainland China and Taiwan. It not only enhances exchanges between the Chinese and U.S. library professions, but provides a platform for research and mutual learning for individuals in the East and West. The international seminar project deserves recognition as a very avant-garde project in the library profession as a whole.
College and University Resources
Academic libraries, being already housed in educational institutions, are exceptionally rich in educational resources. Many grant partial or full tuition waivers for employees to pursue coursework and degree programs. About one third of the librarians at Northern Illinois University Libraries, for example, have taken advantage of this resource. Three librarians have been taking classes in a Ph.D. program; three librarians have already obtained master's degrees, two of them subsequently having been promoted to faculty status from staff; four people are studying for their master's degrees. A number of others take occasional coursework for subject content, but not related to a degree program.
Post (library) degree education of this sort primarily addresses acquisition of knowledge in a subject field. More specific proficiencies are generally acquired through staff development programs and on-the-job training. A two-phase study of ARL librarians (Powell, 1988) found that while library school programs and on-the-job training accounted for the bulk of professional knowledge, participants indicated that they would prefer more access to staff development and continuing education programs. In addition to taking advantage of the many formal opportunities for continuous learning, academic libraries can forge their own professional development programs, either internally, or in affiliation with neighboring and consortial libraries. These alternatives offer a great deal of flexibility in meeting unique organizational and staffing needs, and in a period of decreasing budgets, are attractive for their lower costs.
Library Resources
Affiliations for the purpose of staff development and continuing education may be as large as the project described by Grumling and Sheehy (1993), involving a series of seminars for new, younger librarians at three major libraries in Chicago, or as relatively informal as bringing in a staff member from the law library across the street to present a session on legal reference. Cross-library visits between institutions in the same neighborhood are easy to initiate and sustain (Bell, 2009). Academic libraries will find a rich mine of resources for professional development within their own doors. Being generally divided into departments or units based on operational functions (public services, cataloging and acquisitions, etc.), expertise can be transmitted through mechanisms such as cross-training. Northern Illinois University Libraries uses this approach to collaborative learning. The program is coordinated by a library committee of volunteer librarians. Any librarian may request to be trained during working hours in almost any of the library's units, and arrange the training program and schedule in conjunction with the participating department head. By utilizing the library's own technical resources and personnel, cross-training confers the additional benefits of staying in-house (no travel costs), and easy coordination between trainer and trainee, with minimal disruption of normal work schedules. Cross-training is advantageous for both the individual--improving competencies with input for evaluation and promotion¡ ª and for the library, which acquires more familiarity with operations on the part of more personnel.
Turning from skill-based proficiencies to the acquisition of corporate culture, particularly as it relates to such matters as publication, evaluation and tenure, involves the establishment of mechanisms to facilitate interpersonal communication. Academic librarians frequently ""lack an understanding of the rules of conduct which govern and assure success in the academic arena"" (Neroda & Bodewin, 1983, p.157). Mentorship is an excellent solution, pairing older with newer librarians. A more diffuse form of mentorship may be effected through in-house presentations by established faculty on topics of benefit to younger librarians as they work to establish their publication and service records. Northern Illinois University Libraries has held successful ""brown-bag"" meetings on tips for publishing.
Peer coaching is another means to provide opportunities for staff to learn from each other. Peer coaching, in which librarians interact as equals, ""is a confidential formative process that can aid librarians in fostering skills they choose to examine"" (Levene & Frank, 1993, p.35). A less formal type of peer coaching is engaged in by most librarians in that quick meeting in the hallway or in someone's office to discuss hints for the use of a new database, or the successful trial of a new teaching exercise. The element that tips these informal interactions into the arena of professional development is that the corporate culture supports and encourages their transaction. The University of Minnesota's Biomedical Library has utilized a program of in-house presentations and meetings for training and updating reference staff¡ ª a successful and flexible informal professional development program (Block, 2001).
In communication terms, mentorship and peer coaching support dialogue between individuals, and presentations direct an information flow to group participants. Professional development groups provide a third model that encourages the exchange of information and interaction in a group setting. The Research and Writing Groups sponsored by the Library Faculty Association at Oregon State University (Sapon- White, 2004) give faculty a venue for peer criticism of manuscripts and presentations and for discussion of professional issues. Many libraries hold general Faculty Forums for the discussion of ongoing events, and these can be co-opted, much like the more informal ""brown bag"" meetings, to address specific topics in personal scholarship. Online forums greatly expand opportunities for delivery of training modules, and for provision of virtual meeting spaces, such as the ""open classroom"" calendar at Kapi'olani Community College in Honolulu, through which faculty can connect with mentors, teleconferences, and an online coaching database (Hiser, 2008).
IV. Administrative Support
Academic librarians need information on an ongoing basis that has not been, or cannot easily be provided by their formal education or on-the-job training. Professional development is the catch-phrase for a variety of avenues through which this need may be met. It provides an immediate benefit to individual staff, improving their proficiency. As a group, that proficiency translates into an improved staff resource, and ultimately, into improved user services.
Administrative support is an obvious and essential element in the professional development process. Library administration provides funding, release time, and the bestowal of positive evaluation for achievement, but the real and necessary contribution of administration is that it confers structure to the entire enterprise. Needs are recognized, objectives defined, and opportunities provided. Havener and Stolt (1994) report from their survey results that ""a supportive organizational climate has a major positive impact on librarians' professional development activities"" (p. 35). Access to funding and release time for research and professional development are also an integral element of faculty status conditions for academic librarians (Cary, 2001).
From a managerial point of view, professional development works for success in two camps: human resources and institutional success. On the human resources front, individual librarians' subjective awareness of the importance of persistent learning and dynamic motivation, equally important in guaranteeing success in continuing education, are stimulated, maintained, and promoted by administrative means. As demonstrated, the means and delivery of content are diverse and flexible. As university and library budgets dwindle, administrators may support more local, internal, and distance-education applications, but their primary contribution remains the provision of opportunities that encourage and reward the acquisition and performance of new knowledge and proficiencies. The benefits resulting from this commitment accrue to individual librarians, the parent institution, and the library profession (White, 2001).
V. Conclusion
Information and library science is an interdisciplinary field. The library's clientele is a diverse one, including students and faculty, community members, and scholars and researchers from every discipline. In order to provide quality services to that population, librarians need to commit themselves to continuous learning. The saying, ""Knowledge is boundless"" describes a universal realm of knowledge seeking. Knowledge and scholarship provide the common ground on which the members of the academic community meet. The great flexibility of professional development initiatives --formal or informal, large or small, virtual or real --ensures that library professionals will be well versed in the skills essential to promoting the advancement of both their patrons and themselves. What is most important is that those professional development opportunities be provided.",3223,3648

The field of academic librarianship is constantly shifting and librarians need to make sure they are prepared for these changes. The goal of this article is to describe the importance of professional development (PD), explain the crucial role library administrators' serve in supporting PD, present characteristics of PD best practices, and offer examples of PD models that incorporate best practices. Given the documented benefits of PD, library administrators need to actively support and encourage librarians to engage in these activities.
",2020-12-18,Journal of New Librarianship,University of Colorado at Boulder,"
Academic librarianship is a field that is constantly changing. Librarians often find it difficult to remain up to date on the skills required to provide the quality services and resources library users need. Given the evolving nature of the library profession, it is imperative for academic librarians to seek professional development (PD) opportunities to learn new skills and adapt to additional job responsibilities. The goal of this article is to describe ways library administrators can support PD, present characteristics of PD best practices, and offer some examples of PD models that incorporate those best practices.
Importance of Professional Development
Professional development is defined as ""activities and efforts whether formal or informal that are employed by an individual to upgrade his/her knowledge, abilities and competencies in order to become a more effective professional in exercise of his/her professional duties throughout his/her working life"" (Rafiq, Jabeen, & Arif, 2017, p. 25). Professional development is so vital to the library profession it is listed as one of the eight guiding statements in the ""Code of Ethics of the American Library Association"". The Professional Ethics (2017) code states, ""We strive for excellence in the profession by maintaining and enhancing our own knowledge and skills, by encouraging the professional development of co-workers, and by fostering the aspirations of potential members of the profession"" (para. 6). This statement emphasizes that each librarian is responsible for their own PD as well as for promoting their colleagues and those who may be considering a library career. Implied in this statement is that library administrators are responsible for providing PD opportunities.
Participation in PD opportunities is crucial for academic librarians to remain knowledgeable and competent as the job responsibilities for academic librarians are in a constant state of flux. In an ACRL essay titled ""Changing Roles of Academic and Research Libraries"" (2018) it states, ""the business of libraries can now be understood as one component of a rapidly evolving, almost wholly transformed environment in which information is proliferating at heretofore unimagined rates and in which the ability of academic libraries to deliver authenticated and reliable information is continuously challenged by new technologies"" (para. 4). In order to assist administrators, librarians need to document their expertise as well as identify the skills they would like to add to their repertoire. If administrators have a clear map of their employee's skills, they are better able to plan for any deficiencies (Johannessen, 2018, p. 13). It is important for librarians and administrators to work together to identify PD opportunities.
Benefits of Professional Development
According to the scholarly literature PD has an impact on librarians and the users they serve. Deodhar and Powdwal (2017) reported from their study that PD helps librarians keep pace with technology, acquire subject knowledge, and increase their efficiency and productivity (p. 128). Research has also shown that long-term and engaging PD activities are beneficial to a librarian's personal growth. Attebury (2017) noted in her qualitative study that librarians benefited from PD experiences because they could ""remedy gaps in knowledge resulting from limited or dated library school degree programs"" (p. 240). According to Tomaszewski and MacDonald (2009), when librarians participate in PD, it benefits library users once they apply what was learned to professional practices such as library instruction or collection development. Even informal PD activities, such as discussion groups and journal clubs, can have an impact on library user experience. Fitzgibbons et al. (2017) determined that these PD programs strengthen research skills and yield new initiatives for librarians to implement for library users.
Professional development programs have been shown to be beneficial to the institution where a librarian belongs. Professional development activities can create ""positive changes in a library as a whole"" and allow librarians ""to avail themselves of learning opportunities related to areas of librarianship outside of their normal job duties [which] can spur 'out-of-the-box' thinking that benefits the entire organization"" (Attebury, 2018, p. 426). Eichenlaub, Grover and Thomas (2019) noted that international library job exchange programs benefit librarians and the libraries they serve. Eichenlaub et al. (2019) found librarians who participated in the PD program returned to their library with a ""fresh perspective"" and an enriched ""understanding of research and scholarship across cultures"" (pp. 23-24).
The librarians were able to use their experiences to share innovative ideas for making useful organizational and service changes (Eichenlaub et al., 2019).
Administrative Support for Professional Development Administrative support of PD offerings and participation is crucial as administrators determine if librarians can use their work time, whether any expenses are paid for by the institution, and if PD is valued in promotion and tenure decisions. In a survey of incentives to professional development for academic librarians who work in small and rural libraries, Kendrick, Leaver, and Tritt (2013) found, ""more funding (27%) was identified as the primary motivator for seeking CPD (continuing professional development) opportunities"" (p. 61). Following this model, incentives can be offered for librarians to share their PD experiences with colleagues (Attebury, 2018, p. 409). At some institutions, librarians receive overload compensation to offer PD workshops in their areas of expertise. In addition to incentivizing PD participation by offering release time and possibly compensation, administrators can make it easy to market PD opportunities. One marketing tool is to gather information on PD resources in a libguide that is accessible on the library's website and can be frequently updated.
The report on the state of professional development in higher education found that an increasing number of administrators say that PD is of strategic importance to their institution, yet 70% of managers' report that they have no PD written plans (Mrig et al, 2016, p. 9). A written plan, as well as monetary support, is important as it confirms the institution's commitment to PD. In addition to a written policy, the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) adds that best practices for PD include a commitment from administrators to coordinate PD activities for the library ( Varleis, 2016, p. 69). It helps make the case that PD is valued if administrators engage in continuous learning and share their own PD experiences at staff meetings or in more formal presentations.
Best Practices of Professional Development for Academic Librarians
The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) Guidelines for Continuing Professional Development: Principles and Best Practices outlines the best practice features of PD (Varleis, 2016). Some of the guidelines and best practices for PD highlighted in IFLA include regular assessment, accessible learning opportunities, allocated funding, and administrative commitment to allow staff time to focus on PD (Varleis, 2016, pp. 8-10). The IFLA guidelines propose that PD programs need to be designed ""to support the employing organization's goals for excellent service"" as well as the employee's goal to learn new skills and ultimately contribute to the library professions growth and improvement (Varleis, 2016, p. 9).
Librarians need to ensure their PD efforts are focused on areas that benefit their work responsibilities, their career goals, and the institution they serve. On-going assessment of PD activities are crucial because it guarantees the programs are meeting the needs of the participants and the institutions where they work. Assessment also offers an opportunity to provide feedback on what is working and what may need to be revised. In addition to formal assessment, librarians may choose to keep their own journal to reflect on their PD participation.
Studies have shown that librarians are more likely to participate in PD programs they view as useful to their career goals. For example, various models of PD are offered at Central Michigan University and surveys are used to gather feedback on the most effective programs. The results of the surveys showed the PD programs that focused on technology applications were reported by the largest number of participants as being ""very useful"" and ""most likely"" to be attended (Guo, 2014, p. 550).
Based on the assessment of the challenges of the PD program, i.e. scheduling conflicts, an e-newsletter was created. The e-newsletter was used to publicize PD opportunities, provide follow up, and feature invited speakers (Guo, 2014, p. 549).
The Library at Wake Forest University has a collaborative mentoring model of PD that includes panel presentations, advice on committee participation, and journal reading groups (Keener, Johnson & Collins, 2012). In addition to participants in the program sharing their expertise, the library administrators also speak to the group and share their professional knowledge (Keener et al., 2012, p. 134). This model, in keeping with IFLA best practices for continuing PD, demonstrates administrative commitment on the part of the library administration who participate and share their skills.
In a study conducted on the value of academic librarians' engaging in journal clubs, Fitzgibbons et al. (2017) identified several best practices from the participants involved in the eighteen different journal clubs. These included obtaining administrative support, designating leaders, defining goals, and learning applicable work skills (Fitzgibbons et al., 2017, p. 782). As in other PD models, the participants found it difficult to devote time to the activity as well as focus on implementing the ideas that emerged from the journal club (Fitzgibbons et al., 2017, p. 782).
Another example of a PD program that includes IFLA's PD best practices is Towson University's ""Teach Around"" program. This internal PD program uses a peer learning model. Librarians are invited to present a thirty-minute session on a topic they believe would be useful to their colleagues. The benefits of this program are that it builds collegiality, facilitates the acquisition of new skills, and helps the participating librarians learn about one another's area of expertise (Tomlinson, 2014).
The reflective peer mentoring program, created by the Canadian Association of Research Librarians (CARL), also demonstrates some of the best practices outlined by IFLA, such as periodic assessment. The librarians who participated in reflective peer mentoring program critiqued the recorded library instruction sessions of their peers. Each librarian involved in the program records their class presentation and at a later date, a group of the librarian's peers meet and reflect on the recorded session. The goal as stated by Goosney, Smith and Gordon (2014) is ""to facilitate high quality teaching and to provide the opportunity for librarians to strengthen their instructional practice through observation, supportive dialogue, and reflection"" (p. 3).
At California State University San Marcos, librarians tried a team-teaching form of PD to improve their skills in presenting the library component of the first-year experience course (Matlin & Carr, 2014). A challenge of this collaborative form of PD is that it requires a lot of time and effort but participants noted many benefits. Participants found they became more ""intentional"" about their teaching when given the opportunity to reflect with a colleague on what worked and what did not work (Matlin & Carr, 2014, p. 65). The team-teaching activity was assessed by the participants via a personal narrative. It was reported that the collaboration ""allowed (participants) to gain both practical skills … and cultural knowledge specific to my institution and department"" (Matlin & Carr, 2014, p. 64). In keeping with IFLA's best practices, there was an assessment component and opportunities for participants to improve their skills.
Conclusion
Engaging in professional development is important for academic librarians as it impacts their ability to effectively address the needs of students, keeps them abreast of changes in the profession, and influences their career advancement opportunities. It is crucial for library administrators to strongly support librarian's efforts with release time, budgetary support, modelling, etc. In order to optimize impact, PD programs should include the best practices outlined in IFLA's guidelines for continuing professional development (Varleis, 2016). Given the documented benefits of PD, administrators need to actively promote and encourage PD activities for the betterment of their institution, their clientele, their staff, and their profession.",2489,2856

Participation in continuing education and professional development are crucial to the practice of librarianship as a thriving profession. However, increasingly tight budgets, stagnant salaries, small staff, and lack of access to current technologies may prevent active academic librarians who work on small and rural campuses from fully participating in professional development. As the duties of the modern librarian continue to evolve, efforts to ensure access to quality ongoing training for 21st-century information professionals from all areas of the North American landscape remain paramount. This study explores how academic librarians in small or rural library environments keep up with modern library practices, network with colleagues, and access formal and informal opportunities for continuing education and professional development. The study also identifies barriers to training opportunities for academic librarians on small or rural campuses and investigates the links between continuing education barriers and professional association membership.
",1980,Physiotherapy Canada,,"Introduction
The characteristics of a profession have been well-documented in the literature across many disciplines. Generally, a profession is characterized by a focus on public service, a locus of control over who is admitted to the profession, access to professional privileges, a code of ethics, and most importantly, a body of systematic theory that members learn via lengthy education processes. In later literature, another characteristic has emerged: members of a profession have a commitment to continuing education. [1][2][3] The American Library Association (ALA) continues to ensure that librarianship reflects the characteristics of a modern profession via a broad Code of Ethics (COE) that articulates the common concerns and duties of LIS professionals. Within the ALA COE, the importance of continuing professional development (CPD) is addressed in Principle VIII: ""[W]e strive for excellence in the profession by maintaining and enhancing our own knowledge and skills, by encouraging the professional development of co-workers, and by fostering the aspirations of potential members of the profession."" 4 While the ALA COE offers expectations for CPD, the ability of Library and Information Science (LIS) professionals to fulfill this ethical responsibility may be inhibited by financial, technological, or institutional factors. In particular, these barriers may be a larger issue for librarians who work at small or geographically isolated academic institutions. This article investigates challenges and opportunities academic librarians at small and rural academic institutions encounter as they attempt to locate, access, and participate in CPD.
Literature Review
Since their inception, discussions about formal library education and CPD have been wrought with debates tinged with regret about early missteps and optimism about future prospects for quality offerings. A literature review uncovers several histories of American library training and education, including books, [5][6][7][8] an encyclopedia entry 9 and numerous articles. [10][11][12][13][14] In the winter of 1986, in celebration of the library education centennial, Library Trends published an entire issue dedicated to professional development. 15 Literature covering continuing education and professional development appears along a similar continuum, starting in 1965 with Rothstein's short lecture on continuing professional development 16 and continuing with Stone's worthy dissertation and subsequent books and articles. 17 -20 Similar to the library education symposium, in 1971 Library Trends chose to highlight continuing education as its theme for an entire issue.
Academic librarians have focused on various issues and concerns surrounding CPD: published articles discuss the relationship between librarian faculty status and commensurate opportunities for continuing education, 21 comparisons in type of library and professional development activities, 22 and the role of CPD as it manifests in mentoring via professional associations. 23 Shrinking budgets coupled with higher travels costs and conference fees underscore the difficulties librarians face as they try to keep up their skills while towing the bottom line financially. Academic library professionals have offered up their useful data, best practices and workarounds in hopes that 1) higher education funding will flow again and/or 2) academic librarianship will benefit from the creation of higher quality, adaptable CPD models that overcome hard economic times or isolated locales. 24,25 The scarcity of CPD literature comes into sharp relief when the focus is on small and rural academic libraries. The authors were able to locate general articles about barriers encountered in the context of reference service 26 and solo librarians' personal professional development, 27 but except for one article assessing the use of the Internet to train rural librarians, 28 research focusing on rural and small academic librarians' access to CPD opportunities is practically non-existent. Also discovered was a summary of responses in the Center for Rural Librarianship's Issues and Trends Facing Rural and Small Libraries report. The report noted ""education (in library service and continuing education),"" ""continuing education, training and re-training,"" and ""online training"" were repeated concerns for librarians at rural and small organizations. In the same report, barriers to CPD opportunities were also mentioned: ""budgets are declining,"" ""gas prices make traveling for staff training expensive,"" and ""small staff does not allow time for conferences."" 29 Despite the gap in literature focusing on small and rural academic libraries, the larger body of CPD literature offers contextual frameworks that can be applied to these environments. Formal and informal channels to CPD for librarians in all specializations are covered significantly. 30,20,31 Additionally, the role of social media and technology in CPD has been discussed. 32,33 General discussions about barriers to CPD for librarians have also been covered, including quality of training, 18 handling the effects of economic recessions, 34,35 budget and funding/institutional support, 36 environmental factors, 37,38 and the role of motivation in seeking out CPD opportunities. 39,40 While these articles are informative and contribute to the CPD discussion overall, they do not address the unique challenges that LIS professionals in smaller or isolated academic environments may face. This article takes up the torch of CPD issues as they pertain to academic librarians working in rural environments or small libraries. The study applies two definitions of continuing education. The National Council on Quality Continuing Education's (NCQ) definition emphasizes personal responsibility: ""... self-initiated learning in which individuals assume responsibility for their own development and for fulfilling their need to learn."" 41 Stone's broadened CPD definition recognizes informal and formal paths to lifelong professional development: ""continuing library education …consists of all learning activities and efforts, formal and informal, by which individuals seek to upgrade their knowledge, attitudes, competencies, and understanding in their special field of work (or role) in order to: (1) deliver quality performance in the work setting and (2) enrich their library careers."" 20 The study also considers best practices for CPD as outlined by Varlejs' comprehensive guidelines, which offers ten tenets for promulgating quality library CPD on an international scale. 42 The included exploratory study focuses on how academic librarians in small or rural libraries locate and participate in formal and informal CPD opportunities. The study also identifies barriers to CPD for academic librarians working on small or rural campuses and tests for relationships between professional association membership and barriers to CPD. Additionally, the authors summarize how this group of LIS professionals has implemented ways to increase CPD offerings and circumvented barriers to quality ongoing LIS education in the workplace.
Methodology

Instruments and Procedure
A twenty-four question survey was created using GoogleDocs, a collaborative word processing tool. The questions were divided into three general areas: general characteristics, professional development, and conclusion. After the tool was tested to determine validity and how long it took the average respondent to complete the survey, the content was uploaded into LimeSurvey, an open source survey and questionnaire tool.
After the survey was entered into LimeSurvey, the questionnaire was tested again for validity and timing. Upon successful testing, the tool was given a permanent URL and launched for seven weeks. When the survey closed, responses were checked for errors and prepared for testing within LimeSurvey and SPSS.
Survey participation was requested through several electronic mailing lists (LISTSERVs). Chosen LISTSERVs include a selection of national, academic, state, and specialized library discussion lists. LISTSERVs include reference and instruction (RUSA-L, ILI-L), state library associations (LIB-IDAHO, SCLA-L, GLA-L), special libraries (ALL-SIS, TS-SIS, GODORT-L), national ALA divisions (NMRT-L) and population-oriented (RURALIB-L) organizations. Participation was also sought out via social networking sites such as LinkedIn, Google+, and Facebook (authors posted survey invitations on their personal profiles, state library associations, and special library group pages). During the survey period, two additional participation reminders were sent to the same LISTSERVs and social networking sites. When the survey was closed, there were 282 responses. All surveys were reviewed for completion, and the pool was furthered limited to credentialed academic librarians practicing in the United States. When these filters were applied, 218 surveys were found to be viable for the study, and those data were input into SPSS. In addition to the survey, four participants were interviewed about their specific experiences about CPD access. The interviews were held confidentially; therefore, interviewee identities are withheld and labeled I1 -I4. Interviewee responses and participant comments from open-ended survey questions are included to give context to the study's results.
According to the Academic Libraries: 2010 First Look report, there are 26,706 academic librarians working full-time in the United States. Of that number, 6,374 work at institutions consistent with the VS2, S2, VS4, and S4 Carnegie Classifications. 43 Thus, the present study findings do not reflect holistic views of CPD access or barriers for small or rural academic librarians.
Results

Participants
To define ""small academic libraries,"" the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education's Size & Setting Classification for very small two-year (VS2), small two-year (S2), Very small four-year (VS4), and Small four-year (S4) institutions (FTE <500 -2,999) was consulted. 44 To define ""rural area,"" the United States Census Bureau's definition (< 50,000 people) was used. 45 Participants in this study currently work in a rural or small academic library and possess an ALA-accredited Master's degree (n=218). Of the surveyed respondents, 11% were male and 88.5% were female. Age was almost evenly distributed among respondents, with 28% between 25-35 years of age, 24% between 45-54 years of age, 23% between 55-64 years of age, and 21% between 36-44 years of age. Two percent (2%) were under 25 years of age and 2% were over 65. The majority of respondents live in the American Midwest (33%), followed by the Southeast (24%), Northeast (20%), West (12%), and Southwest (11%) (Figure 1). When asked to identify how long they have worked as an accredited librarian, the majority of respondents indicated fifteen years of experience or more (35%), followed closely by new librarians with zero to five years' experience (30%). Twenty-four percent of respondents have worked between five to nine years, and 11% have ten to fourteen years' of professional library experience.
Less than two-thirds of all respondents (62%) do not possess nor are currently working on an additional advanced degree beyond an ALA-accredited Master's degree. A quarter of respondents have an additional Master's degree and only 5% have earned a Ph.D. At the time of the survey, 7% of respondents were working towards an additional advanced degree.
Respondents were asked to identify their academic library type. The majority of respondents (44%) worked at a four year private college or university, while 29% worked at a four year public college or university. Eighteen percent (18%) of respondents were employed at a two year public junior, technical or community college. Three percent (3%) worked at a two year private junior, technical or community college and 6% chose ""other"" as their type of academic institution (Figure 2).
Respondents also identified some staffing details about their libraries. A majority of respondents worked at a library with two to three librarians (34%), and 23% worked at libraries with four to five librarians. Solo librarians made up 17% of respondents, and 14% of respondents reported that they worked at libraries with eight or more librarians.
Twelve percent (12%) of respondents were at libraries that have six to seven librarians (Figure 3).
Considering the real-world challenges of work in small libraries, several respondents indicated more than one primary work function. The majority of respondents had reference/instruction duties (38%), followed by administration/management duties at 27%. Thirty-five percent (35%) worked in a myriad of other areas (i.e. circulation, interlibrary loan, technical services).
Institutional support
Institutional support often determines a librarian's ability to participate in CPD. It is so critical to CPD that Varlejs stressed its necessity in four of her ten best practices for CPD.
""Organizational commitment and leadership from staff development and continuing education administrators with expertise in adult continuing education…"" ""[c]onsistent documentation of individuals' participation in learning and recognition of continuing learning in hiring and promotion decisions..."" ""[a] minimum of 0.5 to 1.0% of institutional budget earmarked for staff development..."" and ""[a]bout 10% of work hours provided for attendance at workshops, conferences, in-service training, and other educational activities, and for informal learning projects."" 46 Participants in this study were asked whether their institutions provided support of professional development. Eighty-eight percent (88%) of respondents acknowledged that their institutions provide support for professional development opportunities. Only 11% said their institutions do not provide support for CPD.
When asked about how their institutions provide support for CPD, 92% of respondents indicated that their institutions provide time off to attend conferences or continuing education courses. Given the ability to choose more than one option, respondents also cited financial support (78%) as the second most popular form of institutional support. Just over half of the participants (51%) indicated that their institution allowed librarians to teach or lead in-house training. Fewer respondents indicated that their institutions recognized continuing education credits (6%), offered merit rewards (5%) or had an active in-house library training/development department or staff person (4%) (Figure 4). Open-ended comments highlight that while the library/institution may support professional development, it can be sporadic or 
Continuing Education Topic Areas
Survey respondents were asked to identify which subject areas were most important for their CPD (Figure 5). Technology was ranked as the most important area for librarians at small and rural academic libraries (86%). Information literacy/instruction was also ranked highly by respondents, with 75% citing its importance for professional development. Respondents also noted the importance of the following subjects: digital libraries/institutional repositories (43%), collection development (33%), reference (30%), scholarly communication (28%), technical services (25%), and archival/rare books and manuscripts (14%).
Discovery of Professional Development Opportunities
Varlejs' best practices call for ""[w]idely disseminated information about continuing education and resources, accurately described."" 47 When asked where they learn about professional development opportunities, 96% of respondents identified LISTSERVs as their primary method of discovery. Fifty-eight percent (58%) cited the assistance of other librarians or library staff in helping them learn about CPD opportunities. Fifty-six percent (56%) of respondents also used library education/consortia websites (e.g., OCLC, LYRASIS, etc.) to discover CPD opportunities. Social media played an important role in helping respondents learn about educational opportunities: one-third of respondents cited blogs and another 34% cited social networking sites (Figure 6).
Access to Professional Development Opportunities
Online access to CPD opportunities exceeded other methods of access to CPD for librarians at rural and small academic libraries (93%). Eighty percent (80%) of respondents attended conferences to access CPD. While 57% attended in-person training/classes, 51% of respondents took a more independent approach and read books for CPD. Since LIS is a practice-based profession, it is not surprising that 37% accessed professional development opportunities on-the-job (Figure 7).
Frequency of access to professional development opportunities varied for small and rural academic librarians. Just over a quarter (27%) accessed professional development opportunities monthly and 23% accessed CPD once a quarter. Sixteen percent accessed CPD once every six months and 14% accessed CPD once a year. While 3% accessed CPD daily, 3% also indicated they do not seek any professional development opportunities.
Networking
Networking with other librarians is an essential form of CPD. When asked how they network with other librarians, 48% of respondents indicated involvement in informal mentoring relationships, while only 9% have taken advantage of formal mentoring.
Another avenue for networking is through committee work. Forty-six percent (46%) of respondents claimed participation in regional or state committees for networking, while only 16% said they joined national committees in order to network with other librarians.
Respondents also were asked about conferences as an avenue for networking.
Respondents primarily used regional or state conferences for networking sixty-eight percent (68%) and only 37% of respondents indicated they attended national conferences for networking (Figure 8).
Association membership. A major component of networking and connecting
with the profession of librarianship and other librarians is through association membership. Interestingly, only 65% of librarians from rural and small academic libraries claimed membership in ALA. Fifty percent (50%) of respondents indicated they were members of the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) and 11% indicated they were not members of any professional library association. The remainder of responses fell at 3% or fewer: Special Libraries Association (3%), Association of Small and Rural Libraries (2%), and the American Association of Law Libraries (1%).
The responses in the ""other"" category were state, regional or specialized association memberships (48%).
The authors tested association membership data to determine whether ALA membership had a significant impact on the ability of academic librarians at small and rural libraries to take advantage of networking opportunities. Figure 9 shows the number of ALA members versus non-members who were able to take advantage of networking opportunities. A chi-squared goodness of fit test indicated no significant relationship between ALA membership and networking opportunities (χ² (1) = 1.99; p = .16).
Respondents who are members of specialized, regional, or state library associations --but who are not ALA members --are as likely to seek out networking opportunities (conferences, mentoring, committees) as respondents who are ALA members.
Social media. In a related networking question, respondents were asked about the role of social media as a vehicle for interacting with other librarians. Forty-six percent (46%) of respondents utilized Facebook for networking, 36% used LinkedIn, 20% used Twitter, and 13% used ALA's social networking site, ALA Connect. Thirty-four percent (34%) of respondents said that they did not use social media for networking (Figure 10).
The authors tested association membership data to determine if membership had a significant impact on the likelihood of librarians at small and rural academic libraries to use social networking sites for professional development. Figure 11 shows the number of ALA members versus non-members who identified as utilizing a social networking site.
A chi-squared goodness of fit test indicated a significant relationship between ALA membership and social networking engagement (χ² (1) = 5.1; p = .03). Respondents who are ALA members were more likely to report using social networking than non-ALA members.
Barriers to Professional Development
Academic librarians working in small or rural environments are keen to locate CPD opportunities. In fact, a lack of interest in seeking CPD was cited as a barrier by just over 1% of respondents. At the center of this study is the identification of barriers that prevent small and rural academic librarians from seeking CPD opportunities. Figure 12 provides an overview of barriers to CPD as identified by respondents. These variables were also tested against ALA membership to determine if ALA members were less likely to face barriers to CPD opportunities. While testing revealed no significant results regarding relationships between CPD barriers and ALA membership, in open-ended comments and interviews study participants underscored the existence of hurdles to accessing professional development.
Funding. Keeping in mind that just over three-quarters of respondents indicated their institutions provide financial support for CPD, there is an inverse relationship to how that financial support is presented. Respondents indicated the primary barrier to seeking CPD was funding (22%). Open-ended comments included frustrations about limits on travel for professional development purposes:
We have $500 to spend on development for the five of us each year. I regularly look for webinars and such but even many of those are $200. We can't do anything that costs that much. And in spite of the fact that we are within forty miles of one of the largest cities in the southeast, there are few development opportunities (workshops/conferences/training/etc.) within reasonable driving distance. -Respondent My colleagues at bigger institutions are able to attend more conferences and training opportunities, most of the time with full funding. I am generally limited to attending only those where I am presenting something unless it's very local and cheap. -Respondent However, a comment from an interviewee highlights that even when set funds are available, it may not get used. When asked if every librarian takes advantage of the established travel/CPD budget available to each librarian, one respondent stated: Not every librarian. Some of the librarians have tenure and they are no longer doing as much conference work, and some of them just don't for whatever reason. -I1 Conversely, another interviewee noted that her library focuses and uses available funding to attend local and state conferences without fail:
Well, we are able to go to the [state library association] conference every year. That is standard procedure for us… from a financial standpoint, but also from a people resources standpoint, it seems much more intelligent to do as much training as we could either regionally through [the state college and university library association and the state library association], or with the webinars. -I4 Travel distance. For small and rural academic librarians, travel distances were identified as the second most significant barrier (17%).
There are not as many opportunities in small communities that are far from metropolitan areas. Travel to attend many sessions can be prohibitive because of time and funding. -Respondent Many of the national organizations (ALA, SAA, etc.) hold many of their most useful/applicable prof. development sessions and conferences in major metropolitan areas which are not easily accessible from our rural location. Longer travel times, coupled with lack of direct financial support by the institution for prof. development, mean that costs of attending such events are higher than others in more populous locations or with easier access. -Respondent Time. Having insufficient time to participate in CPD opportunities is a major barrier to CPD. In this study, time was a barrier to CPD for 16% of respondents.
Respondents explain:
There is so much to do that getting each day's required tasks done is an accomplishment; taking time out to do something that is not critical at this moment is hard to do.-Respondent I tried to do a webinar once... I was sitting at the desk trying to do this webinar. I was able to sit in on it for ten minutes. I had to close out because I was constantly being interrupted. -I2 Staff. Fourteen percent of respondents indicated that staffing limitations prevent them from seeking out CPD opportunities. Respondents and an interviewee agree: Because of staffing issues, it can be hard to get the time to attend conferences. As a solo librarian, I find it important to actually attend conferences and network with other professionals person to person. -Respondent Although my institution provides funding and time off to attend conferences and such, it is a strain on my staff. -Respondent …[B]ecause we are a small teaching library staff, it's not always convenient to go ALA Midwinter, that kind of thing, because it requires shifting a teaching load to other library staff who already have their own teaching load. -I4 Budget cuts. Eleven percent (11%) of respondents cited the reality of budget cuts as a barrier to seeking CPD opportunities. Sometimes these cuts include conflicting fiduciary goals, highlighted succinctly by a respondent: I hesitate to budget monies for continuing education because the money could be used to add to an electronic resource or to buy a treatise for a professor's research. -Respondent Conversely, some librarians find limited budgets are a boon for innovation and creativity:
[W]e don't have huge budgets, but there's a lot of things that we do creatively, and I think we do a lot because we do so much professional development informally and flexibly. Then when we go see what other people do, we're disappointed that they're acting like this is a novel idea, and we've been doing it for a while already. -I3 Other Barriers. While the following issues were not choices in the survey instrument, open-ended comments and interviews revealed more barriers to small and rural librarians' access to and engagement with CPD.
Isolation. Several respondents mentioned the negative emotional impact of being physically separated from larger professional communities of practice and how it plays a role in preventing continuing education: I find that the isolation is the hardest. Little or no opportunity for face-to-face collegiality. Many great ideas cannot be implemented with very small staff. -Respondent
We have to be very intentional about finding opportunities and must find ways to attend conferences. The isolation can stagnate. -Respondent
Perceptions of libraries and professionalism. Respondents and interviewees
recognized a negative perception of the LIS profession could adversely affect access to CPD opportunities: I think that sometimes the reason why the professional development is somewhat overlooked by others in positions like deans and directors is because they don't see our positions as professional. -I2 I feel that working for a private university, the importance of librarians and their knowledge set is greatly overlooked. Funding is not allocated for continuing ed for librarians, the way that it might be for full time faculty members. -Respondent.
Conversely, other interviewees acknowledged positive links between professional development and perceptions of LIS professionalism on their campuses, as well as the strides their library or university administration has taken to encourage equitable access to CPD for LIS professionals:
[The library dean] really wanted us to be able to make an impact as being real faculty members, because we have faculty status. We're not necessarily seen that way on campus...[s]o he has strived to build relationships with the provost and the president and the university to really show them the need for having tenure track librarians, and to validate that through our own research and development. -I1 I think it's pretty impressive that although we're not considered officially faculty, the university has made it plain to us that librarians should participate in professional development and making the funds available to go, especially to the state library conference, it's great. -I4 CPD for small and rural academic libraries. Locating quality, relevant, and useful CPD opportunities was also mentioned as a barrier to active participation in continuing education. Varlejs' best practices for CPD also highlight the significance of applicable and quality training, including a ""[b]road range of opportunitiesboth formal and informal; formal offerings in a choice of formats, designed to meet identified needs, in modules structured to cover topics from introductory to advanced,"" 48 and ""CE activities design that includes learning objectives aligned with identified needs; selects course instructors on basis of both subject knowledge and teaching ability, attends to transfer of training and feedback."" 49 Echoing the challenges of small and rural academic libraries in locating relevant CPD opportunities, one study respondent asserted:
[I]deas presented at larger conferences are geared more towards academic libraries where there are more staff members and people can do some specialization and have time to pursue a wider variety of activities. I've not found a niche in ALA or even my state association that truly addresses the needs of small academic libraries. Small public libraries are supported, but the academics are generally forgotten when it comes to training tailored more specifically to our needs. -Respondent
Incentives to Professional Development
Survey respondents were asked what incentives might prompt them to seek CPD (Figure 13. More funding (27%) was identified as the primary motivator for seeking CPD opportunities. The existence of local CPD opportunities was seen as an incentive for 16% of respondents. More time was identified by 16% of respondents and lower pricing/more free training was also viewed as an incentive by another 16%. More pay or other recognition was a perceived incentive for 12% of respondents. All other responses fell at or under 7%: explicit job requirement or change in duties (7%), opportunity to teach others (6%), flat training courses (6%), in-house training (4%), and tiered training courses (3%).
Overcoming Barriers
Finally, interviewees were asked about how they circumvented barriers to professional development. 
Discussion
A majority of small and rural academic librarians' CPD goals are supported by their institution, primarily through offering time off and secondarily via providing financial support; however, this same group recognized that supportespecially financial supportmay be sporadic. Many respondents rank technology and information literacy/instruction as the most important areas for CPD. Consistency in funding is a key factor impacting the ability of small and rural librarians to stay abreast of the latest best practices, tools, and resources in these and other areas of applied academic librarianship.
Small and rural academic librarians use the Internet, relying heavily on LISTSERVs to discover and access CPD opportunities. This group also prefers to access training when it is available online, with conference attendance a close second.
Considering the issues regarding consistent financial support, it is likely that conference attendance would be preferred overall if fiduciary constraints were lessened.
The important link between networking and CPD is evident in this study, especially at local and regional levels: in addition to over half the respondent group indicating their participation in formal and informal mentoring relationships, a little less than half of the group have also joined local or regional committees in order to create professional networks. Additionally, over two-thirds attended state and regional conferences for the purpose of networking. Unfortunately, these numbers drop significantly when it comes to national networking opportunities: less than 20% joined national committees and just over a third indicated that networking was a concern when attending national conferences.
Regardless of the lesser role national conferences play in networking, small and rural academic librarians remain loyal to the main LIS professional association (ALA) and appropriate division (ACRL), at least in membership. Only 35% of respondents are not members of ALA, and",6182,7134

This study investigated the influence of training and development on employee performance in selected university libraries in South-West, Nigeria. The survey research design was adopted for this research work. A structured questionnaire was used as an instrument of data collection. The total enumeration technique was employed, and out of the total copies of the questionnaires administered, 103 were completed and returned. Frequency distribution and percentages were used for analysis, while the hypotheses were tested using correlation and regression analysis tools of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The result of the study showed a significant correlation between staff training and development and employee performance in university libraries in Nigeria. The result of this research also showed that staff training and development significantly influence the performance of library staff in selected university libraries. The study, therefore, recommends that university libraries management should regularly organize training and developmental programs for their employees. Furthermore, the research suggests that library employees should be encouraged to participate in training organize within and outside their institutions, as this would ensure increased performance/productivity.
",2009,Library Philosophy,,"INTRODUCTION
Across the world, organizations have sought to rely on improved skills, knowledge, and capability of the talented workforce to create competitive advantage (Shu-Rung & Chun-Chieh, 2017). To develop the desirable skills, knowledge, and capability of employees and position them to perform their responsibilities, managers in charge of human resource training design different training programs (Lakra, 2016). Such training programs not only target to improve the familiarity of employees about their responsibilities, but it also helps to encourage employees to develop more commitment towards their job. Huang and Jao (2016) explained that organizations design training programs to prepare their employees to perform their duties correctly and according to the laid down standards. Organizational personnel design training sessions to ensure that they optimize the potentials of employees. Khan and Baloch (2017) opined that the majority of organizations prefer to invest in different programs that create new skills through long-term planning. This is to enable them to adapt to any current and future uncertainties. Therefore, they ensure that they improve the performance of their employees through superior levels of commitments and motivation.
According to Gatti, Angel-Urdinola, Silva, and Bodor (2011), Employee training is a program aimed at helping employees gain specific skills and knowledge. The acquired knowledge and skills are provided to assist employees in improving their job performance (Gatti, Angel-Urdinola, Silva & Bodor, 2011). Training is developed through organized programs that ensure employees are given skills that are essential in the job market. Therefore, before embarking on this kind of training, it is vital for any agency first to understand the needs of employers. Take, for example, Lebanon, both government and private agencies (Khoury et al., 2014) undergo training. This approach helps in training as many employees as possible to make them qualified for better jobs. There are also other essential reasons why employee-training programs are developed. For instance, training makes it easier for an organization to retain excellent talents that help in the growth of profits. With exceptional abilities, an organization can overcome challenges of operation. In return, the employers lay down well-developed strategies, and significant milestones are reached in regards to performance. Although employee training should not only be offered to attract better jobs, it should also be supportive towards achieving organizational strategic path.
According to Jaoude (2015), organizations providing high-level training have been able to realize three times increasing profits compared to competitors. However, to possess such high impact programs and employees is not simple; it requires a mixture of alignment and planning. This involves developing and designing training in a manner that meets the organization's top goals. Furthermore, employee training should be based on gaps in the job market. This is done through the identification of what employees possess regarding skills and the ideal ones required for the job. Through this approach, training can effectively be offered based on motivation, skills mastery, and giving critical thinking skills to employees. Lastly, training should be done based on practical and class lessons to produce effective and sustainable skills in the workforce (Urdinola, 2013).
Staff training and development constitutes one aspect of the human resource management processes in any organization. It is the most potent tool of any organization's success. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (2006) defines training as ""bringing a person to a desired state of efficiency by instruction and practice"". Development is also defined by the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (2005) as ""change that makes a product, plan, idea, etc. better"". The training and development of an employee are, therefore, regarded as one of the most critical functions of effective resource management and service delivery. According to Rowley (1995), training and development is necessary for the maintenance of the human resource base of the organization and must be viewed as an integral part of the core organizational strategy. Casteleyn (1992) Opined that all libraries aim to have efficient staff to provide an excellent library service to the public they hope to serve, whether that readership is using a Public, University, School, or Private library. To Adeniji, Babalola, & Adeniji (2012), library buildings and extensive collections without skilled professionals can be described as glorified warehouses. Training and development, therefore, is of the utmost importance in the library field. However, each library organization must decide for itself what it means by a desired state of efficiency, as requirements will differ from library to library and country to country. However, the training and development should be designed to ensure efficient performance to the dual benefit of the library system and the users. This study focuses, therefore, on investigating the influence of training and development on employee performance of library personnel in selected libraries in South-West, Nigeria.

Training and development do not significantly influence employee performance of library personnel in university libraries in South-West, Nigeria
REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE
The constant changes in economic, political, educational, and social developments which occur leave the library profession with no alternative but to adapt their services in response to these changes. Staff training has become increasingly important as jobs have become more sophisticated and influenced by technological changes. To this end, staff training needs should be taken seriously to keep up with the rapidly changing trends. For instance, an appropriate training environment is one that mirrors the experience. Most often, resources such as funding are wasted when the organization fails to link training with organizational goals and strategies. Rapid changes in job requirements are increasing the importance of cross job retraining. For organizations to obtain the best returns on the investment made on their employees, they should take training and development programs seriously. It is a fact that organizations that use training technologies to acquire skills and knowledge also enable employees to apply whatever they have learned to the job rather than solely relying on lectures as a means of training employees. Training empowers the individual to apply the knowledge and skills required for the job or task. Staff is an essential component of any library management system, so their training and development needs must be assessed continuously. This would enable staff to perform effectively in a rapidly changing environment. A lack of knowledge, skills, and attitudes prevents satisfactory job performance. Devi and Shaik (2012)  Training is said to be useful when the training outcomes match with their objectives. Training programs should, therefore, be designed and delivered to meet the needs of both the employees and the organization. The employees should be able to apply what they learned on the job, and this should reflect in reduced cost of production, saved time, improved services, increased customer satisfaction, improved morale, decreased grievances or complaints, and improved capabilities to meet future demands and higher productivity. The way to know if there was an improvement is to have these variables, that is, time, service, morale, capability before training and after training, measured to determine if there was an improvement (Hurque and Vyas 2008;Kunche, Kumar, Guniganti & Puli, 2011). Asare-Bediako (2008) suggests that training transfer could be facilitated through collaborative efforts involving three parties, namely, trainee, trainer, and supervisor and that each of them needs to take some action before, during, and after the training program. It is, however, difficult to measure training effectiveness, because training results may not be immediately reflected in the job performance of the trainee. What is even more difficult is the measurement of training results in monetary terms. Creg and Bradley (2000) explain that while many attempts have been made to measure the effects of training in financial terms, the complexity of organizations and the myriad variables involved often frustrate such efforts. There is also extreme difficulty in isolating the impact of training in reference to job performance. Training programs are, therefore, effective only to the extent that the skills and behavior learned can be transferred to the job. It is also important to emphasize that training efforts have the most lasting beneficial effects when staff is engaged in the discussion about the training right from the planning stage. In this way, training is likely to impact positively on job performance. training programs. This will give room for the introduction of new techniques, provide for succession, enable qualified placement, and raise the standard of unskilled personnel. Akintunde (2004) also supports the argument that staff training and development initiatives contribute enormously to the job performance of library workers.
Job performance can be defined as all the behaviors employees engage in while at work (Jex 2002). Job performance refers to how well someone performs at his or her work. Definitions range from general to specific aspects and from quantitative to qualitative dimensions. Going by literature, defining and measuring job performance was not a straight forward process. These days, it is agreed that job performance consists of a complicated series of interacting variables of aspects of the job, the employee, and the environment (Berghe, 2011, citing Milkovich et al. 1991). The need for high performing individuals that would help the institutions meet their goals, to deliver the products and services they specialized in, and finally, to achieve competitive advantage is vital. Performance is also essential for the individual. Accomplishing tasks and performing at a high level can be a source of satisfaction, with feelings of mastery and pride. Low performance and not achieving the goals might be experienced as dissatisfying or even as a personal failure. Moreover, performance, if it is recognized by others within the organization, is often rewarded by financial and other benefits. Performance is a major, although not the only prerequisite for future career development and success in the labor market. Although there might be exceptions, high performers get promoted more easily within an organization and generally have better career opportunities than low performers (Van Scotter, Motowidlo, & Cross, 2000).
Historically, there have been three approaches to define the dimensions of job performance (Berghe, 2011), one as a function of outcomes; as a function of behavior; as a function of personality traits. The majority of the studies have shifted their focus on defining job performance in terms of outcomes and behavior since these are easier and more objective to define and to observe than personal traits (Hersen 2004). According to Pugno (2009), job performance can be defined as the set of behaviors that are relevant to the goals of the organization or the organizational unit in which a person works. Therefore, the job performance of an individual plays a vital role in an organization's growth. This is because it profoundly influences the overall firm's performance and also functions as the critical variable in work and organizational psychology (Sonnentag and Frese, 2002). Job performance in the view of Oduwole (2004) is how one carries out the task, duties, and responsibilities associated with a particular job. Commenting further, job performance, according to him, is considered as an output of staff on the job, measurable in terms of quality and quantity of job performed or done. However, individual job performance is not stable and can fluctuate over time. Studies have shown that the performance of an individual change by changing the time spent on a specific job. At the same time, individual performance improves as a result of learning, and high performance is always the result of greater understanding towards the particular task instead of a greater effort to the job (Sonnentag, Volmer &Spychala, 2011 citing Frese andZapf, 1994).
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
The survey research design was utilized for this research work. The population of this study comprises of library personnel which is professional, para-professional and supporting staff in selected University libraries namely; Adeleke University Library Ede; Fountain University Library Osogbo; Hezekiah Oluwasanmi Library (Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-Ife); Osun State University Library Osogbo, Tekena Tamuno Library (Redeemers' University Ede) and Kenneth Dike Library (University of Ibadan). The total enumerative sampling technique was adopted for this research work because of the size of the population under study. A structured questionnaire was used as an instrument of data collection. The data collected were analyzed using appropriate statistical tools of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS).  However, the respondents agreed that training and development enhance employees' morale in their libraries (x ̅ = 4.73). The respondents agreed that training and development make employees more eligible for promotion in their libraries (x ̅ = 4.28). The respondents strongly agreed that training and development help their library to increase productivity with (x ̅ = 4.60). The respondents agreed that training and development help employees in their library assume control over their jobs with (x ̅ = 4.42). The respondents agreed that training and development programs organized by their library are relevant to their job (x ̅ = 4.08). The respondents agreed that the appropriate training methods and development programs are adopted by their organization to train library staff with (x ̅ = 4.01). The respondents agreed that their organization considers training and development programs important for its employees (x ̅ = 4.06). The respondents agreed that the training and development methods employed by their organization are the best with (x ̅ = 4.13).
ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
The respondents strongly agreed that training and development have a positive impact on their job (x ̅ = 4.50). The respondents strongly agreed that the training and development enhance employees' performance in their library with (x ̅ = 4.59). The respondents agreed that training and development enhance employees' creativity in their library (x ̅ = 4.44). The respondents agreed that training and development motivate employees for better performance in their library (x ̅ = 4.45). Finally, the respondents agreed that there is relationship between manpower development and employee performance in their library with (x ̅ = 4.39). As shown in the above table, a Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (PPMCC) was analyzed to determine the relationship between staff training & development and employees' performance of library personnel in selected university libraries. The result shows that there is a significant and positive correlation between manpower training & development and employees' performance, which is statistically significant at (N = 103, r = 0.447, p = 0.000 meaning p<0.05). This implies that as staff training & development increases, employees' performance also increases. The null hypothesis is rejected. Therefore there is a significant relationship between staff training & development and employee performance in the selected universities of study. and development has a significant value of (p=0.000) on the performance of library personnel in selected university libraries. This implies that staff training and development significantly affect the performance of library personnel in selected university libraries. The null hypothesis is therefore rejected at p>0.05. Therefore, staff training and development significantly affect the performance of library personnel in selected university libraries under study.
TESTING OF HYPOTHESES

DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS
The result of the finding of this research work shows that there is a relationship between staff training and development and employees' performance in university libraries in Nigeria. The result also shows a positive correlation, which is significant. The result obtained from this study further reveals that employees' performance in university libraries is largely affected by staff training and development. The result of this research work is in agreement with the findings of Abba and Dawha, 2009;Baldwin, Gibbs and Slough, Cobblah and van der Walt: 2016;Broady-Preston, 2009;Fritts and Casey, 2010;Kisby and Holler, 2009;Mackenzie and Smith, 2012;Paster, 2004;Snyder and Sanders, 1978;Weaver, Holland and Tonner, 2009) whose findings established that effective staff training and development programs have contributed to improved job performance and higher productivity in organizations. The finding of this research work is also in collaboration with the findings of Onyia and Aniogbolu (2011). The study was carried out to study the effects of training and retraining of library workers on their job performance at Delta State Polytechnic Library, Nigeria. The findings showed that staff training and development provided by the organization had contributed to a large extent to staff performance on their job. The result of this research work also supports the argument of Akintunde (2004) that staff training and development initiatives contribute enormously to the job performance of library workers. The findings also agree with the statements that staff performance, if it is recognized by others within the organization, is often rewarded by financial and other benefits. Also, performance is a major, although not the only prerequisite for future career development and success in the labor market. Although there might be exceptions, high performers get promoted more easily within an organization and generally have better career opportunities than low performers (Van Scotter, Motowidlo, and Cross, 2000).
CONCLUSION
Staff training and development have been identified by various scholars and anchors to be very crucial to an organization and its effectiveness (Olaniyan & Ojo, 2008). In light of the above, university Libraries are therefore encouraged to train and develop their staff to the fullest, to enhance their effectiveness. Through proper training and development, university libraries will create and improves the nature of the present workers. The training and development will influence the conduct of employees and their working abilities, resulting in improved performance and further productive changes that serve to build the performance of the employee. Training and development additionally have a noteworthy part of the employee performance by instilling in them the important skills required to perform different tasks in the University Libraries. The libraries can consider training and developing staff in critical thinking, central leadership, teamwork, and relating to people bringing about beneficial firm-level results. Training is also an important tool for the libraries to patch up the performance of all the staff for the libraries' development and success by expanding staff productivity.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The following was recommended by the study: 1. University libraries' management should regularly organize training programs to ensure employee continuous performance/productivity. 2.
All hands must be on deck to ensure regular quality training and development of staff in libraries to enhance quality library service delivery. This is because, for any library to succeed, training, retraining, and development of staff in all categories in the form of workshops, conferences, seminars, ICT, higher degrees, among others, should be vigorously pursued and made compulsory.
3.
University libraries employees should constantly be encouraged to participate in trainings and developmental programs organize within and outside their institutions.",3949,4313

This study assessed the capacity building efforts of library and information professionals in university libraries in Nigeria. The study adopted a descriptive survey design and a structured questionnaire was the instrument used for data collection. The exact population of the study is 238 librarians in the university libraries in South-South, Nigeria. The total enumeration sampling technique which involves studying the entire respondents was employed for the study. Two hundred and thirty eight copies of the questionnaire were distributed to the respondents; the researchers were able to retrieve only 211 questionnaires. Hence there was 89% response rate. The data collected for this study were analyzed using simple percentage and frequency counts using tables. The findings of the study revealed that the capacity building needs of library and information professionals in university libraries were majorly troubleshooting new technologies, academic research, internet search skills, e-library management, and library automation, among others. Additionally, findings show clearly that on the job training, in-house training, participation in professional association, lecture/ discussion and exercises, and job rotation were the major methods of building the capacity of library and information professionals. It was recommended that sufficient funding should be allocated to university libraries for the organization of capacity building programmes for library and information professionals, among others.
",2021-02-16,Information Impact: Journal of Information and Knowledge Management,African Journals Online (AJOL),"Introduction
Capacity building is the process organizations maintain to develop their workforce to realize their full potential in view of meeting the organization's current and future goals. United Nations Building Programme (2009) defined capacity building as the process through which individuals, organizations and societies obtain, strengthen and maintain the capabilities to set and achieve their own building objectives over time. From the aforementioned definition it is glaring that capacity building help to set and achieve developmental objectives for organizations to succeed. In the same vein, university libraries across the globe are exploring viable means of developing their capacity to enhance their competitiveness and efficiency. Building capacity of employees enhances efficiency, competitiveness and customers satisfaction. Bhattacharjee and Bhattacharjee (2014) posited that in the broad sense, capacity building in libraries is concerned with basically library and information science professional development, library development, and institutional and legal framework development. It is glaring that capacity building in university libraries has three dimensions, the LIS professional development, the university library development and institutional and legal framework development (Bhattacharjee and Bhattacharjee, 2014). This paper will be focused on the capacity building of library and information professionals in university libraries in Nigeria. Capacity building of library and information professionals is currently a topical issue in the literature as no university library can strive without a competent workforce (Ajeemsha & Madhusudhan, 2012). Ajeemsha and Madhusudhan (2012) further posited that staff development is a significant issue in a changing library environment as well-equipped professional librarians are key resources to developing and maintaining a high quality library. The medical profession, law, banking, engineering among others fields are swiftly embracing technological changes associated with this 21 st century that could help boost their service delivery. The library and information science profession should as a matter of urgency move along with the trend to be able to meet the current and future needs of their users. To achieve this aim the need to build the capacity of library and information professional becomes inevitable.
However, in this digital age, university libraries in Nigeria are increasingly embracing technologies for the enhancement and marketing of their services and resources. This technological advancement in university libraries has prompted the need for capacity building of library and information professionals to keep them abreast of how to explore and use the emerging cutting edge technologies for the advancement of their services and resources. The scenario is same in India as Ajeemsha and Madhusudhan (2012) posited that library professionals, especially academic librarians in India are facing challenges in the profession due to the rapid technological changes with the development of cutting-edge technologies in library work/services. Capacity building efforts in university libraries is faced with enormous challenges which are not limited to inadequate funding, lack of willingness by library management to build capacity of professionals, lack of interest to attend capacity building programmes by professionals in university libraries to mention but a few. This study takes a critical look at the capacity building scenario of library and information professionals in university libraries in Nigeria. Currently, only few studies have been undertaken on the capacity building of library and information professionals in university libraries in Nigeria. This lacuna in the literature prompted the need for the study.
Objectives of the Study
The specific objectives of the study are:
 To find out the capacity building needs of Library and information professionals in university libraries in Nigeria.
 To ascertain the method of capacity building for Library and information professionals in university libraries.  To examine the frequency of developing the capacity of Library and information professionals in university libraries.  To investigate the benefits of capacity building programmes on the professional development of Library and information professionals in university libraries.  To identify the barriers to capacity building for Library and information professionals in university libraries.
Research Questions
The following research questions were formulated to guide the study:  What is the capacity building needs of Library and information professionals in university libraries in Nigeria?  What is the method of capacity building for Library and information professionals in university libraries?  What is the frequency of developing the capacity of Library and information professionals in university libraries?  What is the benefits of capacity building programmes on the professional development of Library and information professionals in university libraries?  What is the barriers to capacity building for Library and information professionals in university libraries?
Literature Review
In a study by Bhattacharjee and Bhattacharjee (2014)  University libraries explore various methods for building the capacity of their library and information professionals. Njeze and James (2013) studied capacity building initiatives in preservation techniques: a case study of Nigerian universities. The study revealed that libraries surveyed conduct more seminars (33.93%) and in-house training (30.36%) for its employees. Capacity building initiatives related to conferences (17.86%) appear in the background. Finally, it appears that personal development (10.71%) and e-learning (7.14%) demonstrating initiatives are little used. More so, Agadi, Shokeen and Choukimath (2008)  However, Idiegbeyan-Ose, Ohaegbulam and Osayande (2015) studied conference/workshop attendance by librarians: Benefits, challenges, and prospects. The study revealed that 42 (79.2%) of the respondents attend a conference or workshop once a year, 9 (17.0%) attend twice a year, 2 (3.8%) attend three times a year, and no respondents attend four times or more. Eke ( 2011) did an empirical study of the impact of NLA conference attendance on librarians' professional development. The study revealed that majority of the librarians ( 128) have attended NLA conference 2-5 times (69.1%) and only few ( 8) have attended more than 10 times (4.3%). Those with more experience in the profession have attended more than ten times, especially academic librarians. Newer librarians are most of those who have attended once (15.6%). Adekanye and Ogunleye ( 2016 Bamidele, Omeluzor, Imam and Amadi (2013) studied training of library assistants in academic library: A study of Babcock University library, Nigeria. The findings revealed that 18 (60%) and 9 (30%) of the respondents strongly agreed and agreed, respectively, that training enhances their job performance. The result further showed that training of library assistants will help them cope with the 21st-century library challenges, foster their interest to become librarians in the future, understand the policies guiding the library, and help in the overall services of the library to her users However, Owusu-Acheaw (2017) studied professional development programmes for Polytechnic Library Staff in Ghana: Challenges and Prospects. The study revealed that among the challenges listed, 25 of the respondents representing 34% indicated lack of financial assistance from the institution for professional development as the main challenge. Bhattacharjee and Bhattacharjee (2014) studied capacity building through training program for LIS professionals: A survey on various libraries in Barak Valley (Assam). The findings revealed that 40(60.6%) professionals indicated lack of training programs at a convenient time is the major problem they face which is followed by 37 (56.0%) professionals, who feel the problem was due to lack of permission from higher authority. Moreover, 36 (54.6%), 32 (48.8%), 30 (45.5%), 28 (42.3%), 19 (28.7%), 15 (22.7%) and 10 (15.2%) LIS professionals respectively felt less number of training programs organized in the locality, lack of funding from the employers, lack of time for attending training, communication backwardness, lack of willingness to attend training program, training is expensive for them and training is not compulsory for promotion respectively. Furthermore, 8 (12.1%) professionals also felt that there were some other barriers to participate in the training program. Okiy (2004) carried out an In-house staff training programme at Delta State University Library, Abraka, Nigeria. The problems encountered in the course of the training include limited ICT skills of most of the staff being trained. This slowed down the pace of the training on the computers. In a study by Abba and Dawha (2009) on assessment of personnel training needs in the Ibrahim Babangida Library, Federal University of Technology, Yola, Nigeria. It was revealed from the study that all respondents strongly agreed that funding is a factor that militates against training, while half strongly agree that lack of qualifications is a factor. More than one third agrees that shortage of personnel is a militating factor. Therefore, funding can be considered as a key requirement to the successful and consistent training of library professionals in academic libraries.
Methodology
Descriptive survey research design was adopted for the study and the instrument adopted to elicit data from the respondents was a structured questionnaire with the aid of three research assistants that assisted in distributing and explaining aspects of the questionnaire not clear to the respondents. The population of the study comprises library and information professionals in university libraries in South-South, Nigeria. The exact population of the study is 238 librarians in the university libraries in South-South, Nigeria. The researchers employed the total enumeration sampling technique which involves studying the entire respondents. Two Hundred and Thirty Eight (238) copies of the questionnaire were distributed to the respondents; the researchers were able to retrieve only Two hundred and Eleven (211) copies of the questionnaire. Hence there was 89% response rate. The data collected for this study were analysed using simple percentage and frequency counts presented in tables. From Table 1 above, 139(66%) of the respondents were male, while 72(34%) of the respondents were females. From Table 2 on the questionnaire response rate above, out of the 238 copies of the questionnaires distributed to the respondents, the researchers were able to retrieve 211 copies. Hence there was 89% response rate.

From Table 6 above on the benefits of capacity building programmes, 211 (100%) of the respondents indicated upgrade of professional skills, Effective service delivery, and Increased knowledge on the use of ICT in university libraries, 201(95%) indicated better communication/ interpersonal relationship with users, 187(89%) indicated better E-Library Management, 176(83%) indicated timely service delivery, 122(58%) indicated better academic research writing by information professionals, 114(54%) indicated enhance promotion of library services and resources, improved understanding about the librarianship profession, and 102(48%) indicated error free cataloguing and classification of library materials. Therefore, the benefits of capacity building programmes on the development of LIS professionals include upgrade of professional skills, effective service delivery, increased knowledge on the use of ICTs in university libraries, better communication/interpersonal relationship with users better e-library management, timely service delivery, better academic research written by information professionals, enhanced promotion of library services and resources and improved understanding about the librarianship profession.
Research question five:What are the barriers of capacity building for Library and information professionals in university libraries? 
Discussion of Findings
The findings have revealed facts about the capacity building efforts of library and information professionals in university libraries in in South-South, Nigeria. The study revealed the following: It was revealed from the study that there were more males than female respondents.
The findings of the study revealed that the capacity building needs of library and information professionals in university libraries were majorly troubleshooting new technologies, academic research, internet search skills, e-library management, and library automation, among others. This findings agrees with the study of Bhatti and Nadeem (2014) which revealed that LIS professionals in university libraries in Pakistan need to develop their capacity in troubleshooting new technologies, endnote, data compression, Internet, social media such as Facebook, Blogger, Flickr, Twitter, and online databases. Findings show clearly that on the job training, in-house training, participation in professional association, lecture/ discussion and exercises, and job rotation were the major methods of building the capacity of library and information professionals while mentoring, orientation programmes, conferences, workshop, seminars, e-learning, library tours, academic education were used to a low extent. This finding could be as a result of shortage of funds in university libraries to sponsor librarians to conferences, workshop and seminars to build their capacity. This findings agrees with the study of Agadi, Shokeen and Choukimath (2008) that efficient manpower training programmes must be organized from time to time for librarians via Practical hands-on training to library personnel. The findings also agrees with the study of Khan and Rafiq (2013) which revealed that practical work is methods of providing in-service training for librarians in Pakistan.
The findings of the study revealed that 59% of the library and information professionals attend capacity building programmes every two years, 24% indicated they attend yearly, 11% indicated twice a year and only 6% indicated quarterly. It is glaring from these findings that library and information professionals in South-South, Nigeria do not attend capacity building programmes frequently. The study revealed that capacity building programmes has help in the professional development of library and information professionals in the area of upgrading of their professional skills, effective service delivery, increase knowledge of the use of ICT, better communication /interpersonal relationship with users, better e-library management, timely service delivery, and improved understanding about the librarianship profession. The study agrees with the study of Hosein and Bowen-Chang (2011) which clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of cataloguing training in supporting the cataloguers in their thrust to improve and upgrade their professional skills, and thereby facilitate the transfer of knowledge and practices to entry-level cataloguers. The study show clearly that inadequate funds to organize capacity building programmes, no written capacity building policy and Inadequate support from university management, no proper needs assessment before organizing capacity building programmes, inadequate training facilities/ equipment, no proper evaluation of capacity building programmes for future improvements, and inadequate time to attend capacity building programmes are some of the barriers of capacity building programmes in university libraries in South-South, Nigeria. This findings agrees with the study of Owusu-Acheaw (2017); Abba and Dawha (2009) which revealed that insufficient funds is the major barrier affecting capacity building efforts in university libraries.
Conclusion and Recommendations
The need for building the capacity of library and information professionals in a developing nation like Nigeria cannot be overemphasized especially with the increasing use of information communication technologies in university libraries and other emerging areas in the librarianship profession. Library and information professionals in Nigeria will need to build their capacity in troubleshooting new technologies, academic research, Internet search skills, e-library management, and library automation to be relevant in this 21 century. It is a known fact that Library and information professionals hardly get sponsorship from their university/ library management to attend conferences, workshops and seminars to build their capacity because of shortage of funds.
Instead university/ library management leverage on cost effective method of capacity building such as on-the job training, in house training as well as lectures/ discussion and exercises. Capacity building efforts in university libraries has benefited library and information professionals in upgrading of their professional skills, boosted their service delivery and increase knowledge of their use of ICT for enhancement of their services and resources. In-spite of the aforementioned benefits, some factors like inadequate funding, no written capacity building policy, inadequate support from university management, and no proper needs assessment before organizing capacity building programmes are causing barriers to capacity building efforts for library and information professionals in university libraries. In view of the foregoing the following recommendations were made:
1. Capacity building needs should be tailored towards promotion of services and resources and project management skills. 2. Methods of capacity building should include seminar, conferences, workshops, orientation programmes 3. The frequency of developing capacity should be increased. 4. Regular training should be organise for librarians to boost their competency on cataloguing and classification of library materials 5. Proper needs assessment should be carried out for library and information professionals in order to know areas to channel capacity building efforts in university libraries. 6. Library and information professionals should allocate enough time and be willing to attend capacity building programmes for their self-development. 7. Library and information professionals should attend a minimum of one capacity building programme yearly to equip them with the relevant skills to be relevant in this digital age.",3488,3999

The current professional requirements within the Australian health context for evidential mandatory professional development provided the impetus for a small health library to implement an e-portfolio platform for library staff. The primary objective of the project -to provide staff with a tool to record, store evidence of, and reflect on continuing professional development activities -has been achieved. The most challenging aspect of the project was the requirement for staff to engage in reflective practice. The e-portfolio will also be used for the performance review process with the aim of more closely aligning individual professional and career development with the library's goals and the strategic direction of the parent organisation. While the context of this project was a health library, the findings and implications for practice are applicable to the wider library profession.
",2013-02,The Australian Library Journal,Informa UK Limited,"Introduction
Recent requirements regarding mandatory professional development within the Australian health context encouraged the manager of a small health services library in New South Wales to focus on the continuing professional development (CPD) activities of the library staff. Most health professions in Australia are now required to undergo revalidation of professional qualifications, including producing evidence of ongoing CPD. Health librarians are not required to provide evidence of CPD for professional registration and revalidation, thus they risk falling behind their professional colleagues and being relegated to the administrative or clerical streams within the health workforce. The library's annual performance development and review (PDR) process highlighted that minimal recording of CPD was being undertaken by staff and there was no structured approach to reflection on learning derived through CPD. Continuing professional development in this context is understood to consist of activities that maintain, enhance or extend the knowledge, expertise or competence of the participant (Chipchase, Johnston, and Long 2012). The proposed result of undertaking CPD is to ensure that library staff are able to achieve their career aspirations, and can maintain and improve the standards of professional practice within their workplace (Ritchie 2008).
Objective
A workplace project to implement an e-portfolio tool for staff in a small health library was undertaken with the following objectives:
. To provide library staff with an online tool to record CPD and store documentary evidence. . To facilitate active reflection on CPD activities. . To encourage staff to undertake regular CPD. . To assist staff to prepare for their annual PDR.
As part of this preparation, it was envisaged that the e-portfolio could be used by staff and library management to more closely align individual professional and career development with the library's goals and the strategic direction of the parent organisation by encouraging recording of, and active reflection on, both individual and organisational goals.
Literature review
An extensive amount has been written in the literature regarding professional development, reflection, e-portfolios and their uses within learning contexts. A brief review of the key literature relevant to this project is presented below and is not intended to be exhaustive.
Continuing professional development
CPD is an integral aspect of health professions globally (Jasper 1995;Jensen and Saylor 1994;Kostrzewski et al. 2008;McMullan et al. 2003;Weddle et al. 2002). CPD is fundamental within the Australian health context, as most professions are required to actively participate in and record professional development activities in order to maintain accreditation or registration. The National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions covers 14 professions as of July 2012 (Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency 2012). As a result of CPD's heightened profile within the health environment, the need for a structured CPD program for health librarianship in Australia has also been voiced (Hallam et al. 2010a;Ritchie 2008). ALIA, the Australian Library and Information Association, lists the core knowledge, skills and attributes that are expected characteristics of library and information professionals (Australian Library and Information Association 2005). However, health librarianship is a specialisation that requires the further acquisition of a differing set of skills and competencies. The recent ALIA/Health Libraries Australia project report -Health Librarianship Workforce and Education: Research to Plan the Future (Hallam et al. 2011a) -examined both the current and future roles and skills of health librarians, with reference to seven competencies identified by the US Medical Library Association as specific to health librarianship. Health Libraries Australia (HLA) added a further competency: to maintain currency of professional knowledge and practice (Ritchie et al. 2010). While the focus of the ALIA/ HLA project was health librarianship, maintaining standards of professional knowledge and practice and engaging in CPD is vital to the library profession as a whole. Regardless of the type of CPD undertaken by librarians, it is recognised as important to record any professional development activities as evidence of new knowledge attainment (Saunders 2003). Currently a generic scheme to record and monitor CPD is provided by ALIA, but this is voluntary and limited to members only. Significant changes to the scheme are expected early in 2013. HLA has been vocal in its concern that within the health environment, health librarians who are not required to present evidence of professional competence for registration or revalidation risk being viewed as somehow diminished in professional status (Ritchie 2008). HLA has suggested, therefore, the development of a structured, competency-based framework for health librarian education and ongoing CPD (Ritchie et al. 2010). Further, the requirement amongst health professionals to record mandatory CPD, and the instigation of an auditing process, has emphasised the importance of maintaining e-portfolios for evidence of practice and CPD achievements (Andre 2010).
E-portfolios
An e-portfolio has been identified as a digital tool with the capacity to accommodate diverse file formats (text, image, video and audio), and the flexibility to tailor content for different purposes and diverse audiences (Hallam et al. 2010b). E-portfolios are recognised as tools that can guide and support active learning, reflection, skills acquisition and career development (Randle 2009). They have long been identified as suitable platforms for recording and reflecting on learning experiences (Coffey 2005;McMullan et al. 2003;Smith and Tillema 2003). They are also recognised as useful in assisting with personal development, overall career planning and, importantly, predicting training needs (Australian Learning and Teaching Council 2008). The ALIA/AeP2 study of student e-portfolio use also highlighted the potential for the development of a community of practice based on shared experiences using these tools (Hallam et al. 2011b).
Three distinct purposes of e-portfolios have been identified by Barrett (2004) and reiterated by Ward and Ellis (2007):
. E-portfolios may act as assessment tools for documenting progress and the attainment of standards or competencies. . They may act as tools of reflection and digital stories that encourage critical thinking and deeper learning. . They may act as accessible re ´sume ´s to showcase abilities and achievements.
Admittedly, e-portfolio usefulness is governed by the skills and motivations of the user, and e-portfolios are often viewed as time-consuming (Andre 2010;Dagley and Berrington 2005;McMullan et al. 2003;Osborn 2009;Rossi, Magnoler, and Giannandrea 2008;Wickersham and Chambers 2006). The literature also raises concerns about e-portfolio users' perceived understanding of ownership (Mitchell 1994;Samuel and Haque 2010;Snadden and Thomas 1998;Woodward 1998). Users may be reluctant to utilise the eportfolio fully for reflective practice if they are not convinced of the confidentiality of their e-portfolio's content (McMullan et al. 2003). These disadvantages can be mitigated by the provision of clear guidelines regarding purpose, content, structure and use (Crandall 1998;Gannon et al. 2001).
The convenience of utilising an e-portfolio as a focal point to raise awareness of professional development, and as a tool for recording, storing and reflecting on CPD activities, is clear. Saunders confirms, 'By reflecting on the documents in a portfolio, librarians can identify trends in their career progression and pinpoint areas of strength and weakness' (Saunders 2003, 56). In effect, e-portfolio users are then able to determine what CPD would be most beneficial to undertake in the future.
Reflection
Reflective practice can be viewed as any instance where an individual thinks critically about an action, thought or experience that enables the increase of their self-awareness and professional competence (Epstein and Hundert 2002;Levine, Kern, and Wright 2008). Reflective practice critically examines not only the what, but also the why. It facilitates personal and professional growth and development, and is considered a critical dimension of professional development for all health professionals (Driscol 1994;Howatson-Jones 2010;Somerville and Keeling 2004). Reflection requires routines and habits that can be learned and practiced (Loughran 2002). The process of engaging in reflective practice enables the development of both personal and professional skills, and leads to an integration of knowledge, personal experience, academic theory and professional experience (Donaghy and Morss 2007;McMullan 2006;Thorpe 2004). Further, this newly integrated and formed knowledge can then be applied to future professional outcomes and experiences (O'Halloran et al. 2006).
Reflection is also recognised as a crucial element in e-portfolio use (Abrami and Barrett 2005;Doig et al. 2006;Kidwai et al. 2010;Riedinger 2006;Samuel and Haque 2010). Riedinger (2006) considers that reflection progresses e-portfolios from simple document storage facilities to personal, long-term narratives of knowledge and learning. Further, Grant notes that analytical reflection 'can positively influence an individual's future attitudes, behaviour and professional practice' (Grant 2007, 163). Reflection and reflective writing practices are, however, not inherent skills and require targeted training and development for their successful inclusion in e-portfolio use (Doig et al. 2006;Kidwai et al. 2010;Riedinger 2006).
Method
The literature search that informed the review above was followed by a needs analysis, including a pre-implementation survey of library staff. This survey consisted of questions about CPD and the current PDR process. Determining requirements regarding CPD amongst the library staff necessitated gaining an understanding of user attitudes and needs. This project employed the basic generic model suggested by Maguire and Bevan (2002), which can be used to support the process of generating and validating user requirements. The four stages of this model include information gathering, identifying user needs, envisioning and evaluating, and the specification of requirements. A range of e-portfolios was considered and two were evaluated in-depth. Once an e-portfolio platform was selected, accounts were purchased for all staff and training sessions were provided in using the product and in reflective practice. Both sessions were evaluated by participants at the end of the training. Finally, a post-implementation survey and semi-structured interviews were carried out, to evaluate the implementation stage of the project and scope the future development of the project.
A large volume of data was captured and analysed over the course of the e-portfolio implementation project. The methodological approach known as action research seemed a logical choice for this project, since this type of research is undertaken in real-world situations, and attempts to solve real problems (O'Brien 2001). Further, this type of research does not require objectivity from the researcher, who is free to acknowledge bias to the participants (O'Brien 2001). Action research was therefore employed throughout the development of the surveys, evaluation questionnaires and interview questions that were constructed and distributed.
It was important to the library management that a positive view of the e-portfolio be fostered amongst the staff, in order to encourage their engagement with the e-portfolio platform and CPD activities. The research instruments were therefore purposely skewed toward positive questions for analysis. Staff were, however, free to express negative responses to the survey and evaluation questions, and could comment positively or negatively in the free text responses.
Results

Needs and expectations of library staff
The pre-implementation survey achieved a response rate of 80% (eight out of ten staff). The results suggested that while most of the library staff were engaged in undertaking CPD to some extent, the majority were not following through to the subsequent stages of the CPD process, by either recording or reflecting on their learning. Only three out of the eight respondents (37.5%) indicated that they recorded their professional development activities. Similarly, while three respondents stated that they reflected on their activities, only one respondent indicated that they also recorded this reflection. There was a need, therefore, to provide staff with a suitable tool for recording, storing and reflecting on their CPD, as well as appropriate training in the use of the e-portfolio platform and reflective practices.
Regarding the PDR process, all staff agreed that there were opportunities to get involved in library projects and activities in the workplace, and that there were opportunities for professional development within their field. The majority of respondents felt encouraged to participate in professional-development activities. The barriers to CPD identified most often by the staff included, not surprisingly, time, cost and accessibility, which are issues that could be addressed by library management, within organisational boundaries.
Tasks the e-portfolios would be used for Discussion between the library manager and the project manager established that the eportfolio should provide staff with a tool that enables them to record their professional development activities, store documentary evidence of their professional development and actively reflect on any activities undertaken. The manager's intention is for staff to voluntarily utilise the evidence and reflections stored in their e-portfolio during preparation for the annual staff PDR process, where they are encouraged to discuss any future career goals and staff development objectives in conjunction with the library's objectives and the parent organisation's strategic goals.
Library staff would be the owners of their e-portfolios, since they would be the ones who upload their information into the platform, organise this into views and then specify when they want to share the information, and with whom they wish to share. Their primary needs were to be able to add content easily, to organise it, reflect upon it and then share it with others if they wish. A detailed list of required features was identified, adapted from the list built by the E-portfolio Working Group (2008).
Comparison of e-portfolio products
There are generally speaking two options available for e-portfolio platforms, either a licensed pre-existing product, or an open-source software solution. There are advantages and disadvantages for both options. Much of the documentation and discussion retrieved in the course of preparing for the evaluation advocated the use of either PebblePad (preexisting product) or Mahara (open-source software).
Both PebblePad and Mahara provide the specified requirements in terms of identified user needs as a tool for recording, storing and reflecting on CPD activities. Both systems offer the same type of user experience and functionality. As far as the institutional requirements and costs were concerned, however, the platforms differ in significant ways. Firstly, PebblePad offers complete portability, as the annual licence fee can be taken over by the user/staff member if they are no longer employed at the library. Secondly, unlike Mahara, PebblePad does not require the involvement of IT for set-up and maintenance. For these reasons, PebblePad was recommended as the best e-portfolio platform choice for this project.
Implementation and training
All library staff members were provided with a PebblePad account in August 2012, and training in the use of the e-portfolio and in reflective practice was carried out for all staff over the following two months. The training sessions consisted of a mix of content delivered by the project manager, including practical exercises and opportunities for hands-on practice. Participants were also provided with handouts to which they could refer during and after these sessions. All participants returned completed evaluation forms with questions consisting of a variety of qualitative and quantitative queries covering the delivery of the training, the training material and each individual's estimates of their confidence levels. Overall, the training was very well received and participants indicated that it met their needs in learning how to use the PebblePad platform and increasing their knowledge of reflective practice.
Post-implementation evaluation
The project was evaluated by means of a post-implementation survey and semi-structured interviews. There was an 87.5% response rate, with seven respondents out of a possible eight completing and returning the survey. (Two staff resigned to take up other employment during the course of the project and had not been replaced at the time of the post-implementation survey.) Six (85.7%) respondents confirmed that they were using PebblePad to record their professional development activities, five (71.4%) were using it to store evidence of their professional development, and five (71.4%) were using it as a place to reflect, while two (28.6%) stated that they had not yet used PebblePad for reflection but were about to commence this practice. When asked whether they considered PebblePad to be useful as a place to record professional development activities, five (71.4%) respondents strongly agreed while one (14.3%) moderately and another (14.3%) slightly agreed. The same response was given when staff were asked whether they considered PebblePad to be useful as a place to store professional development evidence. When asked whether they considered PebblePad to be useful as a place to reflect on professional development, three staff (42.9%) strongly agreed, three (42.9%) moderately agreed and one (14.3%) respondent only slightly agreed.
When asked whether they considered that PebblePad helps overcome some of the barriers to undertaking professional development activities, four staff (57.1%) strongly agreed, two (28.6%) slightly agreed and one (14.3%) respondent strongly disagreed with the statement. All respondents agreed that PebblePad would assist them in preparing for their PDR, with two staff (28.6%) strongly agreeing, four (57.1%) moderately agreeing and one (14.3%) respondent slightly agreeing.
Respondents were given an opportunity to comment at the end of the survey. Two respondents provided comments regarding their PebblePad e-portfolio:
Have yet to fully embrace PebblePad for storing and recording but am confident this will occur. Have used it, but not as much as I anticipate.
I am finding PP a very useful tool for recording, storing evidence of, and reflecting on CPD. I feel I have only just scratched the surface of PP's functionality. I think I will use PP to prepare for my next PDR but at this early stage I'm not sure how or to what extent. The main barriers to CPD remain time and money. However, PP helps to overcome barriers in planning for CPD and, most importantly, it prompts the individual to reflect on CPD (rather than just tick a box for attendance). I think this is where the true value of e-portfolios lies.
Two staff agreed to be interviewed following the post-implementation survey. Due to a delay in implementing the e-portfolios, the time available to library staff to explore and use PebblePad was less than originally predicted, so the responses to both the survey and the interviews were based on the premise that respondents had not had as much time as they would have liked to familiarise themselves with the e-portfolio.
Both interviewees were utilising different functions within PebblePad. One had been building a CV, uploading evidence and keeping a blog as part of a university assignment. This respondent found being able to keep all their records of CPD and evidence in one place a useful aspect of the e-portfolio because it is 'good to think that it's all just there . . . it's not on this thumb drive or that thumb drive'. The other felt that 'the most useful is recording professional assets and courses, things you've done, reflections, but in a personal sense I found the whole reflection thing really fascinating. That was very interesting.'
Both respondents felt that PebblePad would be useful for preparing for their annual PDR. One felt that having all the evidence in one place was useful -'it's much easier if it's all just in one spot and I can pull it out or link (the manager) to it' -while the other thought the e-portfolio would help in identifying patterns -'I do think it will be useful, as a template to help you identify your strengths and weaknesses and things that you've actually done and achieved, because providing that structure just helps you to identify things.'
Discussion
The reflective component of CPD seemed to be the most challenging part of the process for some staff, and the most interesting for others. The results of the pre-implementation survey did not make clear why the stages of recording and reflecting on professional development activities were somewhat neglected by library staff but this may have been due to low awareness that these elements are an integral part of the CPD process. If, however, staff were aware that recording and reflecting should be carried out, then perhaps their low levels of observance related to the absence of a suitable tool with which to manage these activities.
The post-implementation survey results confirmed that library staff are engaging with the e-portfolio as a tool for supporting CPD and intend to use it in preparing for their PDR meetings. There are, however, some quite interesting differences in the levels of engagement with the e-portfolio by the staff, which may reflect differences in their awareness of the various benefits afforded by PebblePad. The interviews exposed the fact that there are various elements and functions within PebblePad being accessed and explored by different staff. This is not surprising, considering the range of functionality in PebblePad and the fact that staff were not directed to particular aspects of the software but encouraged to explore the whole product.
Responses to the question in which staff were asked to predict how many hours they expected to spend on professional development activities on average per year following provision of a PebblePad account indicated that for the majority of staff this would either increase or stay the same. It is not possible to attribute a causal relationship between provision of an e-portfolio account and predicted increases or decreases in time spent on CPD, as many other factors impact on CPD commitment. It is important to remember that the use of an e-portfolio is in itself a CPD activity.
There were quite interesting responses to PebblePad being a useful place for recording, storing and reflecting on CPD. The same levels of agreement were obtained in response to questions about recording and storing, however reflecting scored lower. This may indicate the current level of staff engagement with reflection as an aspect of CPD. While the majority of staff confirmed they were using PebblePad to reflect on their CPD activities, they may not yet be confident in either the process or the functionality provided for reflective practices within the e-portfolio platform. They all confirmed, however, that the training had raised their understanding of reflection and reflective practices. It is encouraging to see that, for at least one staff member interviewed, the e-portfolio acts as a prompt for undertaking reflection.
The pre-implementation survey uncovered a range of attitudes and behaviours towards CPD amongst the library staff. The post-implementation survey indicates that awareness of professional development has risen for some staff while confirming that for others this has continued to remain high. Positively for management, all staff felt encouraged to undertake CPD activities and set professional development goals for the future.
Limitations of the study
This study, undertaken at a single institution with a small number of participants, should be considered as an exploratory study. Library managers should regard the results as indicative only, and consider local circumstances when deciding whether this study is applicable to their workplace.
Future directions
Evaluation of the project to date has provided an assessment of the extent to which the original objectives had been achieved, as well as indicating future directions and consolidation of the project. A number of future priority areas have been identified including: the PDR process; alleviation of barriers to CPD; induction of new staff; refresher training; and promotion of e-portfolio use among library staff.
Performance development and review process
It was clear from the surveys conducted that there exists some confusion or misalignment amongst the staff regarding the PDR process, particularly its importance and timing. The library manager should ensure that performance reviews are carried out in a timely manner and given sufficient time and attention. The manager should also encourage staff to use their e-portfolios to assist in preparation for their PDR, particularly the functionality that supports reflective practice. The PDR should be structured to focus on the individual's professional achievements and aspirations in the context of the organisation's strategic direction.
Barriers to CPD
The post-implementation survey found quite markedly differing responses by the staff when asked whether they considered that PebblePad helps overcome some of the barriers to undertaking professional development activities. This disparity perhaps reflects the continuing differences in staff awareness of the various benefits afforded by the e-portfolio, and highlights the continuing need to address the issue of barrier alleviation.
Induction
Purchase of a PebblePad account for new staff and delivery of both the e-portfolio and reflective practices training modules needs to be implemented as a key element in the library's induction process. There is also an opportunity in the future to modify the existing training to develop online/CD-ROM modules. This would enable the training to be an individual/personal, self-paced tutorial session.
Refresher training
Yearly refresher training is currently being considered on the varied range of functionality extant in PebblePad to ensure staff are making the most of the opportunities afforded by the e-portfolio and to keep staff user skills at a high level.
Promotion of e-portfolio use
Within the initial planning stages of the e-portfolio project, it was envisioned that a community of interest around e-portfolio usage should be encouraged and developed. A number of strategies for this to occur include: listing CPD and PebblePad as standing items on the staff meeting agenda as an open forum on usage, including tips and tricks learnt or uncovered; appointing a CPD champion from within the library staff whose role would be to ensure staff are aware of CPD activities and opportunities as they become available, and to seek development activities which address specified needs; and setting up a journal club, where scholarly or industry articles are distributed, critically analysed and discussed. This activity could then be recorded and reflected upon within the PebblePad eportfolio and utilised as evidence for the PDR.
Conclusion
Despite the short time that library staff have had their e-portfolio accounts, two of the four objectives of the project have been achieved, namely to provide library staff with an online tool to record CPD and store documentary evidence, and to encourage active reflection on CPD activities. The project will be further evaluated after 12 months, when renewal of the e-portfolio accounts will be due, to assess whether having the e-portfolio has encouraged staff to undertake CPD and assisted them to prepare for their annual PDR. Of course, provision of an e-portfolio and training in its use is only one strategy that can be used to facilitate meaningful CPD, and the ever-present barriers of time, cost and access to CPD remain. However an e-portfolio is one tool that can be implemented relatively cheaply and easily to encourage library staff not only to record CPD participation but also to reflect on learning, identify gaps in professional knowledge and skills, and plan for career development. It may also prove to be a useful tool for library staff and managers to align individual professional and career development with the library's objectives and the strategic direction of the parent organisation.

This paper, based on the findings of the Library and Information Commission report on Cross-sectoral Mobility in the LIS Profession (Dalton et al., 1999) considers some of the barriers to career development within the Library and Information Services profession.
The LIC report endorses the arguments of Koenig and Safford (1984) and Elkin and Nankivell (1992) among others, that one of the major barriers to career development, within the profession, is the difficulty, encountered by many librarians, of moving from one sector of the profession to another. This barrier is the result of what Koenig and Safford (1984) referred to as the ``vertical stratification'' (p. 1897) of the profession whereby different sectors of the profession (such as academic, public and special libraries) perceive themselves as being separate. Koenig and Safford argued that this fragmentation is reinforced by a ``library mythology'' that encourages the view that different sectors of the profession ``are distinct career paths to which one must make a commitment early in one's career' ' (p. 1897). Reid (1999) acknowledged the existence of such a cultural divide between different sectors of the LIS profession and suggested that it is the result of the developing professionalism of librarianship:
Library and information workers, moreover, are not all the same, nor have their characteristics remained static through time: steady professionalism has brought about considerable changes in knowledge, skills, status and role.
The findings of the LIC research provides evidence that this ``vertical stratification'' or fragmentation of the profession imposes barriers on the movement of librarians from one sector to another and thus inhibits career development.
The difficulties experienced by librarians who try to move sectors in order to develop their careers should be a matter of considerable concern to all involved in the LIS profession. Research has shown that dissatisfaction with the career structure and the failure of individuals to develop their careers accounts for a large number of defections from the profession. Elkin and Nankivell (1992) reported that of all the LIS graduates who had completed LIS courses at the 16 British library schools in 1988,
Abstract
The paper, based on the findings of the Library and Information Commission (LIC) report on Cross-sectoral Mobility in the LIS Profession, considers some of the barriers to career development within the Library and Information Services profession. It focuses specifically upon difficulties experienced by LIS professionals in moving to different sectors of the profession. It discusses issues such as professional segregation; employer prejudice; poor employment strategies; lack of confidence among LIS professionals; training; and lack of professional support. In addition to outlining some of the barriers to the career development of LIS professionals, the paper offers a number of recommendations for employers, professional bodies and LIS professionals that may help to alleviate many of these barriers.

There is no reason to suggest that things may have improved since 1992.
The concerns about ``wastage'' in the profession, raised by Elkin and Nankivell, are reinforced by the findings of the LIC research, in which most of the librarians questioned claimed that they had considered leaving the profession at some point in their career. The reasons they gave for their dissatisfaction with the profession included limited prospects, lack of opportunities for career progression within a sector and the failure to move to another sector of the profession. One librarian who had been working in the medical sector had left the profession to become a teacher. He had considered himself to be ``stuck'' in his job, as there was ``nowhere to move upward within the organisation'' and he was ``having no luck with applications (he) had been making for other posts'' (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 44). Another librarian had left the profession to work in the ICT field. Dissatisfied with his work in the public sector, he had applied unsuccessfully for posts in the academic sector before realising his skills could be employed elsewhere. He claimed that ``it is easier to move out of libraries than it is to cross sectors of the LIS profession'' as there is ``disillusionment in the LIS market at the moment and fewer opportunities'' (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 44).
Unless determined efforts are made to break down the barriers between different sectors of the profession and to establish a profession-wide career structure, it is going to be difficult to retain the pool of well informed LIS professionals that Elkin and Nankivell believed to be ``critical to the long-term future of the profession'' (Elkin and Nankivell, 1992, p. 77).
By focusing specifically upon difficulties experienced by LIS professionals in moving between different sectors of the profession, this paper examines the extent to which issues such as professional segregation, employer prejudice, poor employment strategies, lack of confidence among LIS professionals, and inadequate training create barriers to career development. The paper concludes by recommending ways in which these barriers may be eradicated or reduced.
Research methodology
The LIC report on Cross-sectoral Mobility in the LIS Profession, written by Pete Dalton, Glen Mynott, Clare Nankivell and Denis Reardon, was the result of a research project that was conceived and conducted by the Centre for Information Research (CIR) in the School of Information Studies at the University of Central England in Birmingham. The research (conducted between March 1998 and February 1999) was motivated by concerns about the lack of opportunities for LIS professionals to develop their careers due to the shortage of higher level posts in specific sectors and the difficulties of moving from one sector of the profession to another.
In response to concerns about barriers to career development within the profession, the LIC project sought to examine the nature of the barriers to cross-sectoral mobility by comparing the skills required in different sectors and by considering the attitudes of employers and staff to staff mobility between different sectors of the profession. The intention was to discover the extent to which the barriers to cross-sectoral mobility were due to the lack of appropriate skills (and if so, whether more adequate training could help to alleviate the problem) or to the attitudes of employers and fellow LIS professionals.
The nine sectors considered for examination in the project were the academic, government, public, commercial, industrial, school, further education, medical, and voluntary sectors. The research was conducted in two stages. First, an analysis of 90 person specifications that had been collected over a period of nine months. These comprised, for all nine sectors, two person specifications for each of the five levels identified for the research: pre-professional, first professional, second/third professional, middle management and senior management. Second, a series of interviews was undertaken with 18 strategic managers from the nine sectors and with 44 professionals who had successfully crossed sectors. It had originally been intended also to conduct interviews with individuals who considered themselves ``stuck'' in a sector, but due to a lack of volunteers this was not possible. For various reasons, such as personal sensitivities, few LIS professionals were prepared to identify themselves as ``stuck'' in a sector.
Transferable skills
The interviews and the person specifications indicated that many skills are common to all or most sectors of the profession. In general these include basic LIS skills, communication and interpersonal skills, information and communications technology (ICT) skills, and self-management skills.
The respondents generally believed that basic information seeking and information handling skills are transferable to all sectors. As one pointed out, ``with these as a basis you can move sectors and focus on the other skills that are important to that sector once you are there'' (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 46). Some respondents referred specifically to skills in delivering user education as transferable across different sectors of the profession because, as one interviewee claimed, ``every job has had an element of giving instruction to others ± showing public library users how to use the catalogue, directories, etc. ± showing petroleum engineers how to find relevant information'' (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 46).
Communication and interpersonal skills were considered important in all sectors. Apart from writing and oral skills, these include the ability to deal with colleagues at all levels, teamwork skills and the aptitude to relate to customers or users. Furthermore, ICT skills were considered to be of value in all sectors. One respondent claimed that ``IT skills have figured in all of the posts I have had in all sectors'' (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 46). However, some respondents did stress that the different sectors, and sometimes the range of organisations within a sector, used a variety of computer software. Self-management skills, including planning, organisation and prioritisation were also believed to be required at all levels in each sector.
At managerial level, resource management, leadership, training and marketing skills were considered important in all sectors. Over twothirds of the respondents thought that management skills are transferable across sectors. However, it seems that employers do not always realise this. As one interviewee recognised:
You should be able to transfer management and political skills in terms of how an organisation functions and how things can be manipulated, although it does not seem to happen, there seems not to be an appreciation that these skills are transferable to different environments (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 46).
Although many skills are transferable between sectors, some of the respondents recognised that a different emphasis is placed on skills in different sectors. One interviewee claimed that:
In public libraries and large academic libraries you would need knowledge of cataloguing and classification principles (whereas) in a school library, even though you do catalogue and classify new books, pupil management and curriculum support is more important than having a beautiful catalogued library, so your priorities change (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 47).
Another respondent thought that there were different pressures in each sector and that dealing with users in an academic library presents ``a different kind of pressure from a public reference desk'' (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 47).
Barriers to cross-sectoral mobility
Despite the range of transferable skills between the different sectors of the LIS profession, the research indicates that there are a number of institutional and personal barriers to movement between sectors. These include the lack of a career structure throughout the profession, employer prejudices, poor employment strategies, lack of confidence among some LIS professionals and inadequate training.
Career structure
The research reinforces the concerns raised by Koenig and Safford (1984) and Elkin and Nankivell (1992) that the profession lacked an overall career structure.
The lack of a profession-wide culture was cited by some of the librarians interviewed for the LIC research as a barrier to career development in the LIS profession. The general perception was that there are different cultures and stages of development among libraries in different sectors and that the profession is ``partly segregated'', with people who work in different sectors not contacting or co-operating with each other (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 44).
The shortage or lack of cross-sectoral activities, such as training sessions or conferences was seen to reinforce these divisions. Furthermore, the lack of a single unitary professional body to promote the interests of all LIS professionals inhibits the development of a profession-wide culture. At present, different bodies, such as The Library Association (LA), The Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux (ASLIB) and The Institute of Information Scientists (IIS), tend to represent different groups of LIS employees. This may be remedied to some extent by the planned merger of the LA and the IIS.
Employer prejudice
Although most of the strategic managers who were interviewed recognised the benefits of employing LIS professionals from other sectors, there remained a strong perception that employers prefer to appoint people from within their own sector. It appears that some employers do not acknowledge the transferability of skills between sectors. A majority of the LIS professionals interviewed claimed to have been rejected for posts in academic and public libraries because of a lack of experience in the sector. Such prejudice can be reinforced over a period of time. As one strategic manager from the medical sector pointed out:
If professionals experience prejudice or are led to believe by employers that they have not got the skills to move sectors, later when they are responsible for recruitment in an organisation, they are not likely to think that other people have got the skills to move (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 30).
Employer prejudice was considered to be a major barrier to moving between sectors by some LIS professionals. Academic libraries, in particular, were believed to be at fault. One person claimed that ``some academic institutions seemed to be like closed shops'' whereas another thought that they preferred people to follow a specified career path, ``working their way up within the sector''. Other respondents felt that it was quite difficult to get short-listed for posts in sectors in which they had no experience (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 42).
Some strategic managers acknowledged that they prefer to recruit LIS staff at lower levels and then to promote from within. This is particularly the case in some of the special libraries, where such a policy is pursued, it was suggested, to enable staff from within the sector to develop their careers. In addition, one of the strategic managers who was interviewed claimed that it is easier and more beneficial to train newly qualified graduates than to retrain experienced professionals from other sectors (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 30).
Employment strategies
Some posts in specific sectors are advertised in ways that exclude or discourage applicants from other sectors. It was reported, for example, that the government sector advertised most of its vacancies internally, thus excluding or deterring applications from LIS staff in other sectors. Some of the strategic managers who were interviewed recognised that their inability to attract applicants from other sectors could be due to the failure to ``advertise and present our work in a way that appears open to other sectors'' (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 30). Furthermore, they recognised the need to be more flexible regarding the skills they expect from applicants and in their interview procedures. In addition, the quality of many of the person specifications that were analysed for the project left much to be desired. Many of them did not contain details of essential and desirable qualifications, experience or the skills required for the posts. Others included only very general skills lists and little detail of the specific tasks of the job or of the skills required for it.
LIS professionals
The LIC research project shows that lack of confidence in their transferable skills is, for many LIS professionals, a major barrier to career development and cross-sectoral mobility. Some strategic managers claimed that ``librarians have a very narrow view of their own skills base within a job and do not realise that other areas may call similar things by different names'' (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 31).
There were a number of LIS professionals who believed that the ``big gap in IT between public and academic libraries'' makes it difficult to move from the public to academic sectors (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 43). However, this is not always the case. For instance, one respondent from the public sector who had been rejected for posts in the academic sector later found employment in the ICT profession. This might suggest that the belief that librarians working in the public sector are necessarily short on ICT skills is a generalisation.
Other librarians felt that it was difficult to move from special libraries to the public sector because their use of LIS skills is narrowly focused. It also became apparent during the research that some librarians believed they would not be considered for posts if they had no experience of the sector and that others thought they had become ``pigeon-holed'' into particular sectors. One person who worked in a national library complained that, having been ``labelled as from there'', where the work is very specialised, he now wondered how he would get out (Dalton et al., 1999, p.43). Another librarian, who had been employed for a number of years in the medical sector, was concerned that ``employers would question why he wanted to leave after spending so long there'' (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 43).
Training
Although three-quarters of the LIS professionals who were interviewed claimed that involvement in training activities had contributed to enabling them to move sector, there was still a general feeling that the lack of profession-wide training opportunities limited the possibilities for career development.
One of the barriers to employing people from other sectors mentioned by strategic managers, is the need to provide special training to bring them up to date with the culture and the skills relevant to their sector. This special training often includes a programme of familiarisation with the organisation and sector, including its jargon and terminology, as well as training in sector specific skills. In order to ensure the success of sector specific training it needs to be targeted at the individual needs of employees. This is not always practical in terms of cost and personnel for the smaller, public financed organisations, such as schools and government.
A further problem is that training within specific sectors is focused upon the skills required in that sector, resulting in little time or money being set aside by employers for training in general LIS skills. Owing to the cultural differences between sectors in IT development and in customer core skills, for example, it becomes increasingly difficult for staff to develop skills that may be required in other sectors. One librarian in the school sector claimed that as there is little money for LIS skills training it is difficult to get out of the sector: ``once you're there you are stuck in that mould'' (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 44).
Others had found it difficult to leave the public sector because it is ``not as technologically advanced as others'', thus making it ``difficult to acquire the skills (needed) in order to change sectors'' (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 44).
Other barriers that could be remedied by profession-wide training included poor job application techniques and interview skills. Some strategic managers claimed that a large number of applicants attempting to move sectors fail to address the job specification adequately. It was suggested that this is often due to applicants not knowing enough about what working in a particular sector would involve and to generally poor application techniques (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 31). A few LIS professionals who had failed to be appointed to posts in other sectors put their lack of success down to poor performances at interview level and the lack of adequate preparation (Dalton et al., 1999, p. 43).
Recommendations
Many of the barriers to career development outlined in this paper could be alleviated by more open recruitment practices, greater professional support for LIS staff and the introduction of profession-wide training initiatives.
Recommendations for employers
It is important that employers recognise the transferability of skills between different sectors of the profession. As has been shown in this paper, on the evidence of the person specifications for a range of posts in different sectors of the profession, many of the skills required are common to all sectors. Although there are sector specific requirements, these could be kept to a minimum by the introduction of profession-wide training programmes and cross-sectoral initiatives. However, the major barriers appear to be the assumptions made by employers regarding the skills that LIS staff from other sectors are likely to have or lack and the inability of applicants to market their skills adequately.
Further to this is the need for employers to review their recruitment practices. This would involve designing person specifications in such a way as to encourage applicants from other sectors, for example by excluding requirements for sectoral experience and by providing more specific details of the requirements for the post in question. In addition the majority of posts could be advertised more widely in professional publications and not just within specific sectors and organisations.
Recommendations for professional bodies
Professional bodies, such as the Library Association, ASLIB and the IIS, and trade unions also have a significant role to play in breaking down cultural barriers within the profession. This includes raising the awareness of the suitability of their members and of the transferability of their skills to other sectors. This may require organising profession-wide training sessions and crosssectoral conferences and providing help with individual applications. By working more closely with each other, professional bodies could help to create a professional environment that encourages cross-sectoral co-operation. For this reason, the recent decisions of the Library Association and the IIS to merge into one professional body should be welcomed as a positive step forward for the profession.
In addition, professional bodies could provide support for members who have moved sectors or are considering moving sectors. This could be done through a crosssectoral mentoring scheme or by specific groups within professional organisations. Information could also be provided on what will be expected of an employee in another sector.
Recommendations for LIS professionals
It is important that LIS professionals also take responsibility for their own careers and their individual training needs (at least as far as is possible within the current cultural and financial limitations). This might involve addressing more effectively the person specifications of jobs for which they apply, preparing themselves better for interviews, developing an awareness of the work done in other sectors and building up cross-sectoral professional networks. They could also look further afield for new job opportunities and become less reliant upon employment agencies that tend to try and place people within sectors in which they have had recent experience. Finally and most importantly, librarians need to develop confidence in their own skills and to make greater efforts to market themselves effectively. However, although self-motivation and selfresponsibility have large roles to play in career development, individual librarians also need the help and support of both employers and professional associations.
Conclusion
If the high wastage level of qualified and experienced LIS professionals is to be addressed, it will be necessary to remove the cultural barriers to cross-sectoral mobility and thus to career development. This paper has raised some of the issues involved and suggested action the profession needs to consider if it wishes to remove or reduce these barriers.",4516,5058

From many aspects such as the resource construction, the talent group, and the mechanism and system, main factors to restrain the development of college library are analyzed, and corresponding countermeasures are proposed in this article.
",2011-05-03,International Education Studies,Canadian Center of Science and Education,"Restriction Factors

Factors in Resource Construction
1.1.1 Deficient funds, price rising of books and periodicals, less information, less quantity of literatures and information resources, all could not satisfy readers' demands (Shao, 2000, P.40-42 & Liu, 2006, P.57-58) Because of well-known causes, paper resources and electric resources rise in price, and though colleges increase the expenditure to the library, but the growth of the literature purchasing charge cannot hold a candle to the increase amount of books and database, so many good information resources could not be purchased because of deficient charge, an some databases can only be purchased partly, and the purchasing amount of literature is deficient. In addition, since China joined in WTO, foreign periodicals have not been copied, and the original editions are too expensive, so to expand the order of electric foreign periodicals has been the first countermeasure that the college should consider. And in recent years, the subject and specialty in the college increase continually, which have bring pressures for the construction of literature resources, and the amount of literature information resource has not completely satisfy the demand of the teaching and research.
1.1.2 The development degree of the existing real holding and virtual holding is not enough Because of the amount and quality of employees, some deep-level service works could be developed well, such as the construction of the special database, the development of the free network information resources, and the deep-level development of the existing purchased database. Deficient long-term cooperation mechanism, low-level repeated construction of literature resources, weak sharing consciousness of resource, readers' ideas giving priority to the entity holding of their own library, and weak drumbeating of inter-lending and literature transfer among libraries all directly or indirectly show that readers could not sufficiently use the virtual holdings of library.
1.1.3 Software and hardware establishments of network could not satisfy the development demand of library With the continual development of digital library, the electron, networking, and digitalization services need corresponding software and hardware establishments, and the existing storage space, management software platform, wireless network covering area, and network security establishments about electric resources are badly in need of improvement, and with the building of the Wenjing School Library, to realize the uniform management three school libraries including Ya'an School Library, Wenjiang School Library, and Doujiangyan School Library, the existing software and hardware establishments could not satisfy the demands obviously.
Infrastructures should be further improved
Library is the palace suiting for study, and especially in the middle term and final exam of each semester, the self-study seats in the library will be very nervous, and though many seats are added at this time, but readers' demand still could not be satisfied, and some readers would even study at the side of the bookshelves.
Factors in Talent Group

Less quantity of employees
Comparing with other colleges, the employee amount of the library is fewer, and for two libraries in new school and old school, the employees could basically ensure the basic operation of various departments, and the works in some departments could not be developed deeply. At the same time, because the school is located in Ya'an, and it is one of 211 colleges, and the admittance of the college is higher, it is still very hard to invite high-level professional talents with relative specialty.
1.2.2 The qualities of employees are irregular, and the total level is lower than the level of teachers (Zhang, 2006, P.100-102 & Wang, 2008, P.130-131 & 134) In the age of network, librarians need undertake more roles such as the manager of information materials, information analyzer and organizer, information provider and spreader, information utilization navigator, and information knowledge educator. But in many college libraries, the human resource allocation all lack in high qualification, comparing with the admittance of the teacher group. In addition, college libraries universally lack in the effective planning of human resource, and libraries often could only passively accept employees. Therefore, comparing with the teaching and scientific research group, the real truth is that the librarian group is universally on the lower level. But with the quick development of modern library career, especially with the quick development of the computer technology, the network communication technology, and the information technology, the structure of library human resource obviously lack in high-level, high-professional, and high-talented employees, which is more obvious in the day of the network information times, and many deep-level and individualized services could not be developed. But to evaluate the service quality of one library is always related with the service depth, width, and level of the library, so it is the important factor to restrain the development of library. 1.2.3 Librarians' occupational reputation is not higher, and their competitive and creative consciousnesses are weak Employees in the library should keep strict office hours, with long working time. Librarians have paid large numerous of time, energy, even health for the work. However, the indirection and fuzziness are easy to make people think that library is only a place to hold, borrow, and return books, and the affiliation of teaching and scientific research, and the college only put the library as the place to arrange for surplus employees. Librarians' social reputation is totally lower in the public, and the work is not in popular demand, and the library becomes the ""disadvantaged groups"" in colleges, and the policies of the college incline to teachers, and whether for salary, premium and professional title, or for further study, librarians could be competed with teachers. Their payments in time and energy are hard to be respected and cognized, and this imbalance would largely weaken their work enthusiasm, and make them to lack in sense of belonging and pride to the industry, and lack in energy and vitality, competitive consciousness, and self-realization. Because of the limitation of some librarians' conditions and the relative regulations of the college, they would feel hopeless in the title promotion and post, so they would lack in aspirant dynamic and innovational desire, and their lifelong study consciousness is not intensive, which is also one of assignable causes to restrain the development of library. Without excellent librarians, even if the library has excellent service concept and complete service system, it could not provide excellent service to readers.
Traditional service concepts restrain the service innovation of library to some extents
In the modern information society, libraries' orientation has turned from original knowledge storage and management to knowledge service, and corresponding service concept and mode would change largely. But because of many causes, though some libraries realize that they should adapt the development of the society, and they need liberating their ideas and change their concepts, but they still have not deeply change their ideas, even not the action, and the traditional service concepts still exist in their ideas. For the concept of ""people oriented, reader first, and service first"", some libraries still stay on the surface. The library service is not the problem only with the promise, and it includes concrete and complex contents. With the quick development of information technology, and people's high demands including quick, exact, new, complete, and saving for the information demand, traditional service concept is one of main factors to restrain the service innovation of library.
Factors in Mechanism and System
With the development of the university, three libraries in Ya'an School, Wenjiang School, and Doujiangyan School should be managed and operated uniformly, and new management mode and operation mechanism needs to be explored, and corresponding system and mechanism need to be established and perfected. But the development of these works should be first based on the total orientation of three schools. According to the total deployment of the school, library should take the theory of the Scientific Outlook on Development as the guidance, and continually explore the management mode and running mechanism in the new situation, and the literature resource construction and the talent group construction need forward-looking thinking and overall situation consciousness. Based on the perfection of the existing regulations and systems, relative policies of the school should be properly adjusted to encourage employees' work enthusiasm and provide larger development space, and arouse their innovational consciousness. The school should establish and perfect the employment mechanism and the encouragement mechanism, and fully drive librarians' work enthusiasm and innovational consciousness, and try to introduce required and high-level talents for the library.
Countermeasures
In the activity to deeply study and carry out the Scientific Outlook on Development, librarians should seriously analyze the main factors to restrain the development of the library. Combining with the practice of the library, following countermeasures should be used for references.
First, in the employees including CPC members and general public, the library should deeply study and carry out the Scientific Outlook on Development, and fixedly establish and carry out the library concept of ""people oriented, reader first, and service first"", and confirm the core of satisfying readers' demand as the service quality standard, and provide convenient, intuitional and quick service based on existing establishments. At the same time, the library should change the position to consider readers' demand, and provide deeper and wider service, and comprehensively enhance the service quality of the library, so more people would understand, enter, use, and identify the library. According to the problems from the readers, the library added 11 carrels and 44 self-study seats in the new hall, and further considered the countermeasures according to the investigation result. For the wireless network, the library begun to open the internet with certain condition, i.e. opening the wireless internet in May and Nov of each year when students are busy in the thesis writing.
Second, the library should constitute the scientific and reasonable resource construction plan suiting for the schooling characteristic of the university, including the entity resource and virtual network resource, and scientifically manage and maintain these resources. The library should strengthen the drumbeating degree of the importance of digital library to seek the support from the university, including the outlay investment and the construction of digital library. Universities could unite to purchase the digital resources such as the Vip Chinese Periodical Database, and libraries could undertake the outlay together, and each library could use the limited capitals in the demand most needed. The library should strengthen the depth development degree of existing resources, especially the construction of special database, and deep-level management of existing database, and the digitalization of paper resources, to provide deep-level and individualized services for readers. At the same time, the library could organically integrate the entity holdings and virtual holdings, and strengthen the cooperation among libraries to realize the resource co-construction and sharing, fully utilize the virtual network holdings, and expand the construction and utilization of virtual holdings. The library should deeply explore the multi-school library literature information resource management mode, and reasonably allocate the literature resources of all schools.
Third, the library should strengthen the talent group construction, establish the study-type library, and continually enhance librarians' comprehensive quality and the total quality of the library. Human resource is the most important factor in the library work, and aiming at the practice of the employee structure, on the one hand, the library should actively strive for the support from superior department in charge and reasonably introduce talents, and on the other hand, based on the existing system, the library should establish and perfect the management mechanism and employment system which could encourage employees' enthusiasm (including the competition mechanism, the double-way post selection, the work shift, and the different salaries in different posts), and transfer all active factors which could be transferred to largely exert each librarian's activity. The library should fixed establish the people-oriented concept, respect librarians, and emphasize their demands. Combining with the practice of the library, the people-oriented service should be put into the concrete works. Through various effective modes (such as investigation, short-term training, taking lectures, self-studying, and further study), the library could strengthen librarians' quality, optimize their knowledge structure, and strengthen the construction of the talent group. The library should gradually establish the study-type library, and continually enhance librarians' self-comprehensive quality, and make them work in study and study in work. Each work should be regarded as a study chance, and librarians should study new skills and methods in works, and promote the growth of their professional knowledge. Study should be regarded as a necessary work every day, and the lifelong study habit should be cultivated for every one. Librarians should integrate work with study, and taste the essential of the lifelong study. At the same time, the library should create more and better advantages such as title evaluation and post promotion for employees to encouragement their potential for lifelong study. The library should strengthen the drumbeating to obtain the attention of the superior leader in charge, and enhance the treatment and social state from policies, and strive for fair treatment in salary, premium, title evaluation, and further studying to encourage librarians' sense of reputation, and accordingly librarians' work satisfaction could be enhanced, and they would serve for teachers and students better.
Finally, the library should strengthen the system innovation, further perfect the system and mechanism, and establish and implement the effective employment mechanism which could encourage all employees to be creative and willing contributors in their posts.",2664,2893

Motivation is of enormous importance with regard to enhancing performance in any organisation. This paper discusses motivation and performance of librarians in public universities in Ghana. The study examined motivation of librarians, the effect of motivation on performance, the views of librarians on motivation, the level of satisfaction of librarians and the effort the public university managements are making to motivate librarians. Through literature review, the concept of motivation and its effects on performance were discussed. Using a survey method, questionnaire were designed and distributed to seventy-two targeted librarians in six public universities in Ghana, out of this, sixty returned the duly completed questionnaire. The questionnaire sought to identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors which motivate librarians and how it affects their performance. The study revealed that the motivational level of librarians in public universities in Ghana is high and that the motivational level affects majority of librarians positively. The public university managements have made some efforts to motivate librarians but they need to do more to improve the current situation. The study concludes with some recommendations on how to improve motivational systems in place in public university libraries. The discussions in the paper provides some insights into intrinsic and extrinsic factors that motivate librarians in public universities in Ghana. The paper will therefore be of great value to managers in the public university libraries in Ghana and other developing countries in getting the best out of their staff if adequately motivated.
",2010,Library Review,,"INTRODUCTION
Organisations, private and public, are set up to accomplish their own goals and objectives such as the provision of goods and services. Organisations need people of diverse backgrounds, both skilled and unskilled to exert their energies towards the accomplishment of their goals. People are the greatest single asset available to an organisation. In real terms, an organisation is people.
They constitute the only asset that can work towards an organisational goal. As a result, one major concern of employers is to attract and retain a qualified and dedicated workforce that is willing to ""release its latent energy and creativity in the service of the enterprise"" (Cole, 1997).
In doing so employers use a number of measures, one of which is motivation. Motivation is basically concerned with why people behave in a certain way. In general, it can be described as the direction and persistence of action. It is concerned with why people choose a particular course of action in preference to others, and why they continue with the chosen action, often over a long period, and in the face of difficulties and problems (Mullins, 2005). Motivation can therefore be said to be at the heart of how innovative and productive things get done within an organization (Bloisi, 2003). Thus, if an organisation wants its employees to behave in a certain way to enable it accomplish its goals and objectives, that organisation needs to understand the kind of motivation that will prompt the employees to act in the required manner. Motivation, however, is not about manipulation. It is about understanding the urges and needs which prompt people to doing things and providing ways of helping them to satisfy those needs while at the same time harnesses their contribution to satisfy its (organization) needs (Hacket, 1999). Public universities in Ghana employ three categories of staff in their libraries. The categories are senior members, senior staff and junior staff respectively. The senior members who are also known as professional librarians are holders of postgraduate qualifications in Library Studies or Information Science. In public universities in Ghana, the professional librarians perform both operational and managerial functions. Apart from the positions of the University Librarian and Deputy University Librarian which are regarded as top positions in the Ghanaian public universities administration, professional librarians can also function as Heads of Section within their College, Faculty, Campus or Institute Libraries. This means that professional librarians are supposed to manage and supervise staff working under them at the various levels of management in their respective libraries. It is therefore imperative that this category of staff in the public universities is adequately motivated. This will help them inspire their subordinates to act in the required manner to perform optimally. The right approach to motivation of subordinates by professional librarians will no doubt enable the university libraries to accomplish their goals and objectives of providing the required information for teaching, learning, research, and knowledge dissemination.
The main objective of the study therefore is an attempt to evaluate the degree of motivation of librarians in public universities in Ghana and how it affects their performances and overall goals of their institutions.
Theoretical Framework
The study is based on the content theory of motivation. The content theory of motivation is relevant for this study because it attempts to establish the relationship between motivation and performance of librarians in public universities in Ghana.
Content Theories of Motivation
Content theories attempt to explain the specific things which actually motivate the individual at work. The theories are concerned with identifying people's needs, their relative strengths and the goals they pursue in order to satisfy their needs. The basis of these theories is the belief that the content of motivation consists of needs (Mullins, 2005). The most well known theories in this area include Maslow's hierarchy of needs, Alderfer's need modified theory, McClellard's theory of socially acquired needs, and Herzberg's Motivation-hygiene theory.
The study therefore aims to take advantage of the content theory of motivation. One content theory (Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs) has been reviewed for the study.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Authorities have variously defined motivation. The term motivation derived from the Latin word ""movere"", which means ""to move"". Motivation is therefore defined as ""those"" psychological processes that cause the arousal, direction and persistence of voluntary actions that are goal directed"" (Kreitner 2001). On their part, Mathis and Jackson, (2002) defined motivation as ""the desire within a person causing that person to act"". They contend that people act for one reason: to reach a goal. Hellriegel, et. al (1992) also defined motivation as ""the term used to describe the forces that cause the person to behave in specific, goal-directed manner"".
The above definitions of motivation, suggest that the underlying concept of motivation is the driving force within individuals by which they attempt to achieve some goals in order to fulfil some needs or expectations. Motivation is therefore, a goal directed drive and seldom occurs in a void. Organisational success is dependent upon members being motivated to use their full talents and abilities, and being directed to perform well in the right areas. Performance is a product of both ability and level of motivation, thus performance is (ability x motivation) (Mullins, 2005).
According to Mullins (2005), a major international study by Proudfoot Consulting in the United States of America, revealed that, the most important reason for productivity loss was poor working morale. This includes absence of positive team spirit, low motivation, poor sense of belonging, people feeling undervalued and poorly rewarded. It is, however, worthy to note that performance problems are not necessarily caused by low level of motivation only. Other factors like shortage of resources or lack of skills may be the cause of low productivity in an organisation.
Importance of Motivation
Motivation is of enormous importance with regards to enhancing performance in any organization. Every manager strives to motivate his or her employees to greater and higher performance towards achieving organizational mission. It is the considered view of Moorhead and Griffin (1998) that Performance is dependent on three factors, namely, Ability, Environment and Motivation which can be expressed as follows: P = M + A + E. Ability which is the employees' skill and capacity to perform a given work, can be acquired in the case of its deficiency, through a training program or a transfer to a simpler job. Environment, which refers to the requisite physical material resources and equipment to do the job, can also be provided.
However, motivation that entails a worker wanting to do the job cannot be easily provided or generalised. It requires extra effort on the part of the manager to determine what will motivate the employee to work hard enough to meet set performance levels. Thus, motivation is important in an organisation in as much as it determines performance in conjunction with ability and environment (Moorhead and Griffin, 1998).
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory
One of the best known theories of motivation is probably Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory.
Maslow argues that human beings with innate desires to satisfy have given set of needs. He identified five sets of needs. This is normally presented in the form of a pyramid with each level consisting of a particular class of needs as shown in fig 1. According to Maslow, the first three sets of needs in the hierarchy (Psychological, Security and Belongingness) are referred to as deficiency needs. These must be satisfied for the individual to be fundamentally comfortable. The other two sets of needs (esteem and self-actualization) relate to personal growth and development and are thus referred to as growth needs. In the opinion of Maslow, individuals work their way up the hierarchy, but each level of needs remain independent on the levels below. Thus, if one is motivated at work by the opportunity to ""Self actualize and suddenly he is made redundant, the whole system collapses, as the need to feed and provide for oneself and his dependents becomes the predominant need. organisations these days take keen interest in motivation because it has effect on both employee output or performance and organisational effectiveness.
Motivation in the Ghanaian Public Sector
Motivation among employees in public service institutions in Ghana has been demonstrably low.
For example, employee pay structure compensation accounts for most of the motivational problems in public service organisations in Ghana (Afarega, 2000). Employees in the public sector are unable to make ends meet. It is not uncommon to hear public service employees grumble over the inability of their salaries to sustain them beyond the second week of the month.
Employees have had to resort to other income generating activities for sustenance. This adversely affects their level of motivation and commitment towards the attainment of organisational goals and objectives and ultimately their performance and productivity. This is evidenced in the frequent strike actions embarked upon by employees in the public institutions like the Ghana Health Service, Ghana Library Board and National Association of Graduate Teachers among others for better conditions of service.
The nation, as a result, has lost many professionals in the public service to the developed countries with some of the remaining employees either resigning or vacating their posts to take up more lucrative appointment in the private sector especially the banks. It is worthy to note that the country's compensation policy has led to distortions in the salary levels of the various public service institutions. As such, the situation is different in some public service institutions such as the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority, Volta River Authority, Social Security and National Insurance Trust, among others. These organisations are motivated in terms of good remuneration, good working environment, incentives and the provision of the necessary tools for work (Afarega, 2000). It had been the fervent hope of public sector employees in Ghana that the Single Spine Salary Structure which has been under implementation since 2010, would correct the distortions in the public service salary structure to motivate public sector workers to perform optimally.
Studies on motivation in university libraries
In their study on motivation and productivity in Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Library in Nigeria, Antwi and Bello, (1993) using Maslows' hierarchy of needs theory as a guide, concluded that the administration of the library was successful in motivating Library Assistants to perform their duties effectively. This was largely due to the fact that the librarians in the library were very much abreast with the concept of motivation, hence their ability to motivate the Library Assistants. They however, identified some negative factors like lack of promotion and opportunities for further training and education and unfavourable conditions of service. Afful and Antwi (2001) also found out that the University of Cape Coast Library successfully motivated its Library Assistants through good working relationship and participative management to achieve its organisational goals. They also identified lack of promotion as a factor that adversely affected the development of the Library Assistants. Senyah (2003) came out with similar conclusion that Library Assistants in Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology were adequately motivated through participative communication and good working relationship with their supervisors. He concluded that timely promotion, recognition of experience and on the job training should be given serious attention in order to improve the existing motivational level of the Library Assistants.
In their study on job satisfaction and career commitment of university librarians in Nigeria, Adio and Popoola (2010) reported that, job satisfaction has significant influence on career commitment of librarians. They suggested that, librarians in Nigerian universities should be trained in modern theory and practice of job satisfaction for them to be highly committed to their career because they lacked training in their chosen profession. They also recommended improved conditions of service through good remuneration and recognition. Tsigilis, Koustelios and Togia (2004), asserted in their study on job satisfaction and burnout in Greek academic libraries that, librarians job satisfaction is mainly determined by their parent organisation, working conditions, supervision and the job itself. They also reported that, limited opportunities for academic advancement, unfair promotion policies and slow promotion procedures were the main cause of dissatisfaction among university librarians in Greece. They, however, found out that the relationship between job satisfaction and burnout was negative.
As stated earlier in the study, professional librarians serve as administrators and managers in the university libraries so it is imperative that they are well versed in the concept of motivation. It is the hope of the researchers that by focusing on different universities in Ghana the study would present a clear view of motivation in university libraries in Ghana. A questionnaire was used to gather data for the study. The questionnaire sought to identify the following variables: Employee profiles, occupation information, levels of motivation and management effort to motivate staff. Others were effect of motivation on performance, level of satisfaction of librarians and recommendations on the way forward. Both close-ended and openended questions were used.
METHODOLOGY
A total of seventy-two (72) copies of the designed questionnaire were distributed by the researchers between September and December 2011 to professionals in the six university libraries. Sixty (60) copies were returned giving a response rate of 83%. Responses from the questionnaire were coded and processed on the computer using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Data was analyzed using simple frequencies and percentages for easy interpretation of data.
DATA ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS
Table 1 shows the respondents of the various universities which were surveyed. Out of the expected respondents of 72 librarians, 60 responses were received and analysed. 
Respondents characteristics
From the data collected, there were more male librarians (43 i.e. 72%) than females (17 i.e.
28%) This shows that professional librarians in the public universities in Ghana are male dominated.
Tables 2 and3 give statistical data about the respondents with respect to age and educational qualification.
On the distribution of age of respondents (Table 2), it was found out that majority of the respondents (53.3%) were aged between 41-50 years and 25% were aged between 51-60 years.
The rationale for finding out this information was to relate this to their level of maturity and how they could adapt to situations in their environment such as conditions of service, productivity and work ethics. This clearly shows that most of the librarians are mature. Also those in this age bracket are more expectant with varied needs such as marriage, family commitment and social responsibilities.

Category of Librarians

Years spent on current position
Respondents were asked to indicate the number of years they have spent on their current position. It was found out from Table 5 that majority of the respondents representing 75% have spent more than five (5) years on their current position. Apart from the University Librarians among this number who have reached the highest level of the profession, ideally all these people are due for promotion by the regulations governing promotion criteria in Ghanaian universities.
It can be deduced from the above observation that, either they have not satisfied the promotion criteria or there is a delayed promotion due to bureaucracy in the promotion system which can itself demoralise the affected librarians in the performance of their duties. Source: Field survey, 2011
Prospects for advancement into the next grade
The questionnaire sought to know from the respondents whether there were prospects for advancement into the next grade. It was found out that 88.1% of the respondents indicated that there are prospects for promotion, while 11.9% indicated that there are no prospects. It can be deduced from Table 5 that, despite the high prospects for promotion as indicated by the respondents, majority of them have spent more than the minimum number of four years required for promotion at their current position. This buttresses our earlier assertion that there might be bureaucracy in the promotion system or the respondents have not met other criteria such as getting the required number of publications and satisfactory performance. It is interesting to note that the11.9% who indicated that there are no prospects for promotion, have reached the highest position or were on contract.

In spite of these have confidence in the promotion system, while 16.9% indicated that they do not have confidence in the promotion system.

Job Satisfaction
On whether the respondents are satisfi respondents indicated yes, while 8.5% According to the respondents, the comparisons were based on the status of the librarian, facilities, condition of service (allowances and remuneration), pension benefits, unequal qualification of senior membership, professional exposure and training, opportunities for career development, work environment, and management's commitment to motivation. Making comparison to one's outcome and input and taking decisions thereafter are based on Adams equity theory of motivation (Mullins, 2005). According to Mullins, if people make comparison in relation to their performance and what they receive from their organisation is lower than their colleagues in other organisations, they may experience a feeling of inequity and are forced to choose various options like absenteeism, laziness, apathy and even resignation.
Two most important factors in the job of Librarians in Ghanaian Universities
The survey requested respondents to indicate the two most important factors in their job. It is interesting to note from Table 6 that, 45.8% rated career development as their first most important factor in their job above salary 33.9%. It is worthy to note that, on the second most important factor in the job of librarians in Ghanaian universities, pleasant environment had the highest rating of 32.2% followed by salary with 28.8%. 
Overall motivational level of Librarians
The study attempted to ascertain universities. Figure 4 shows that a significant proportion know their motivational levels, while 32.2% and 23.7% indicated levels respectively.
Figure 4 overall motivational level of Librarians

Among the reasons given by those who indicated that the system rewards hard work, e membership grade; enjoyment of encouraged to upgrade themselves and remuneration is also rewarding. With regards to those with low motivational ratings, their reasons included the following: delay in promotion an
Committees; the library is not seen as a core funct lack of recognition for the role of the librarian in the University set-up; and poor working environment. Those who could not tell their motivational level also indicated that librarians are professionals and have no means of measuring their motivational level. Some also indicated that they have no basis to tell whether their motivational level is high or low since they have not been in the University system for long.
Effect of Motivation on performance of Librarians in Ghanaian Universities
Respondents were asked to indicate how their level of motivation affects their performance.
From Table 7 below, 47.5% of the respondents indicated that their level of motivation affects their performance positively. Further investigation revealed that, the positive effects on motivation on performance of the 47.5%, also affects the overall goals of their institutions positively. However, 23.7% indicated that their motivational level affects their performance negatively, while 28.8% could not tell whether or not their motivational level affects their performance. Source: Field survey, 2011
The positive effect of motivation on 47.5% of the respondents is a good development. However, management of the various universities should make serious effort to reverse the trend of the 28.8% of the respondents who indicated that their motivational level affects their performance negatively, since it has the potential of undermining the overall objectives of the various university libraries.
Rating of Librarians' own performance
It is interesting to note that when the respondents were asked to rate their own performance, 86.4% of them indicated that they put in their best efforts, 11.9% indicated that they were just getting along but could do more, while only 1.7% felt they were not really utilised. It is worthy to note that in spite of some reservations expressed by some of the respondents earlier in the study, 86.4% indicated that they are putting in their best effort. It is important to recognise this and at least to keep them at this level so that they do not fall into the second group of just getting along when they can do more.
Management Effort in Motivating Librarians in Ghanaian Universities
The survey requested respondents to indicate whether or not efforts were being made by management of the various universities to motivate librarians. The survey revealed that 50.8% indicated that management did not make any effort to motivate librarians, while 49.2% indicated that management is making efforts to motivate employees. Those who indicated that efforts were being made to motivate librarians gave the following reasons: librarians have the same conditions of service as lecturers and other Senior Members, they enjoy study leave with pay, fair promotions system, have opportunities to attend workshops and conferences, availability of prospects for career and professional development of staff, training opportunities and strategic plan to improve library facilities. Finally they asserted that librarians are involved in academic and administrative issues.
On the effectiveness of strategies used by management in Ghanaian public universities to motivate librarians, 81.4% indicated that the strategies were effective, while 3.4% indicated that the strategies were not effective. The remaining 15.3% could not tell whether or not the strategies were effective.
Training
On whether there are training programmes for librarians in Ghanaian public universities, all the respondents indicated that there are training programs from which they have all benefited in one way or the other. This shows that management of the various universities appreciate that career development is a big motivator for librarians
Service Benefits
The study attempted to find out if librarians enjoy some service benefits. For housing benefit, 93.2% of the respondents responded in the affirmative while 6.8% indicated that they do not receive any housing benefits. On study leave with pay outside librarianship, 91.5% indicated that they do not benefit from such a facility whereas 8.5% claimed they benefit from it. Interestingly, 98.3% of the respondents indicated that they also benefit from medical expenses refund, with only 1.7% indicating that they do not benefit from such refund.
However, further investigations revealed that 60% of the respondents indicated that these benefits are not easy to get due to bureaucracy and frustrations in the system. Furthermore, on whether the above benefits are enough to motivate staff, 74.6% of the respondents indicated that the benefits are not enough.
Whether Librarians have the intention of leaving their institutions in the near future
Respondents were further asked whether they have the intention of leaving their institutions in the near future. In response, 45.8% indicated that they have not thought of it, 44.1% indicated they have no intention of leaving, whereas 10.2% indicated that they have the intention of leaving their institutions in the near future. It is observed from the above discussion that there is not much difference between those who have not thought of leaving and those who have no intention of leaving their institutions. This shows that the institutions have the potential of maintaining majority of their staff in the near future. However, the various institutions should endeavour to motivate their librarians and provide the necessary facilities and resources to move the 10.2% who have the intention of quitting in the near future into the category of those who want to stay put. This is because, among the main reasons they gave for their intention to quit were that there are better opportunities elsewhere, they lack exposure, workplace dynamism, teamwork and modern facilities.
CONCLUSION
The motivational level among librarians in the six public universities in Ghana, was found to be fairly high. It was also revealed that the motivational level affects majority of librarians positively. The study further revealed that majority of the librarians are young and within the middle age bracket. These categories of librarians are more expectant, with more needs such as marriage, family and social responsibilities to satisfy and thus are willing to leave one institution for another if their expectations are not met. Alternatively, if measures are implemented to motivate them to meet their expectations they could be retained and developed to constitute competitive asset for their institutions.
The study also revealed that librarians in Ghanaian public universities place much importance on intrinsic factors such as career development, study leave with pay outside librarianship as well as good salaries and fair promotion system. This confirms Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory which posits that, human beings with innate desires to satisfy have given set of needs like psychological, security, esteem and self-actualization. For an individual to perform optimally, both deficiency and growth needs, as opined by Maslow, would have to be satisfied. It is therefore imperative for the various universities to evolve proactive measures to motivate their librarians to put in their best and also attract multi -skilled and hard working staff to their fold.",5403,6104

what can library leaders do to support the pro fessional development of librarians as teachers? In an earlier column in this series, Bonnie Gratch Lindauer expressed her belief that many librarians are ""passion ate and disciplined about improving [their] teaching,"" but how much is really known about how to support librarians in that effort?1 The purpose of this column is to review the state of instructional improvement pro grams in libraries and to draw on the broader literature of instructional improvement in higher education to identify issues to which the field must attend in order to foster the professional development of librarians as teachers. Although the examples discussed in this col umn focus on the academic library experience, the les sons one may learn from studying these programs can be applied to any library environment in which teach ing is recognized as an essential feature of the orga nizational mission. If all libraries are now ""teaching libraries/' then all librarians can benefit from thinking about what research and practice has taught us about instructional improvement.
What Is ""Instructional
Improvement""? ""Instructional improvement"" is a term found in the literature of higher education to describe professional development opportunities for college faculty aimed at helping them to improve their performance in the classroom.2 For more than thirty years, students of col lege teaching and practitioners in the faculty develop ment movement have led efforts to help faculty focus on their work as teachers and to identify organiza tional structures that motivate faculty to participate in instructional improvement programs and to ""take teaching seriously.""3 While faculty development pro grams have provided support for a variety of activities (for example, financial support for travel to scholarly conferences), much of the practice in this field focuses on instructional improvement.4 Instructional improve ment activities are coordinated on many campuses through teaching centers, and may include: (1) work shops focused on developing specific teaching skills;
(2) programs designed to provide useful feedback on one's work as a teacher; (3) instructional grants and financial incentives to encourage classroom innova tion; and (4) opportunities to discuss issues in higher Correspondence concerning this column should be addressed to: Lori Arp, Assistant to the University Librarian, Northwestern University Library, 1970 Campus Dr., Evanston, IL 60208; e mail: L-arp@northwestern.edu. Beth S. Woodard is the Central Interest in using teaching port folios and peer review of instruc tional materials is also on the rise in many libraries; surveys have found both an orientation among librarians toward peers as a preferred resource for becoming a more effective teacher and that a significant minority of ARL member libraries have implemented some form of peer review as a strat egy for instructional improvement. Links to a variety of materials devel oped for these programs are available at the Instructional Improvement in Academic Libraries Web site (http:// people.ku.edu/-slwalter/instruction/ index.html). Peer review of instruc tional materials is also being fostered through the development of Web based repositories of instructional materials and programs such as the ACRL Instruction Section's PRIMO (Peer-Reviewed Instructional Materials Online) project (www.ala.org/ala/acrl bucket/is/iscommittees/webpages/ emergingtech/primo/index.htm). 27 No essay of this length can do justice to the many facets of these programs, but the degree to which these ""chang ing models"" for assessment and evalu ation of teaching have been adopted by libraries across the country sug gests that this is an area in which further research will undoubtedly be needed in the future. 28 As much as looking at the broader context of instructional improvement in higher education can help to iden tify what should work in library-based instructional improvement programs, it can also help to identify areas in which additional work is needed. For example, one of the basic tenets of research and practice in instructional improvement is that an effective ori entation to teaching is crucial to new faculty as they begin their professional development as teachers, but there is limited evidence of substantive and formal orientation programs focused on teaching in libraries. Likewise, there is considerable attention paid in the literature of higher education to the role that administrators play in fostering and supporting a culture of teaching in an academic department, but there has been limited attention to this role in studies of library leader ship. Further inquiry into best prac tices for orientation and mentoring programs focused on instruction will be critical to the ongoing develop ment of the teaching library, as will further study of the role of senior administrators as instructional lead ers in the library and advocates for the significance of the library as a center for teaching and learning on the cam pus and in the community.
Conclusion
Why worry about instructional improvement? Quite simply because, even after thirty years of discussion and debate, teacher training is still a relatively minor part of the profes sional education for librarians even as it becomes an increasingly important part of their daily work. Making a com mitment to instructional improvement is ultimately the responsibility of every teaching librarian, but helping to foster an environment conducive to making that commitment is one of the respon sibilities of an instructional leader. 29 Examining the role of the librarian and library administrator as instruc tional leader is a critical area for further research, owing not only to the lessons learned from the literature of higher education regarding the role that such leadership plays in the improvement of teaching and learning on campus, but also to issues unique to the library envi ronment that demonstrate the need for more focused attention on instructional leadership. For example, a recent study of teaching librarians suggested that the lack of an effective introduction to the teaching role during LIS education contributed to a difficult transition into their first professional positions.30
Designing an effective instructional improvement program and making it accessible to librarians and staff as part of fostering a culture of teaching in the library can ease that transition, provide crucial support to new librar ians (and to experienced librarians new to teaching), and aid in recruiting, ori enting, and mentoring the next gen eration of librarians for an information (and, hopefully, information-literate) society.
The models for instructional improvement in libraries discussed in this article may provide the inspiration for a personal commitment to instruc tional improvement, or they may spark the development of an innovative pro gram in one's local library. Either result will mean that there is an opportunity to improve the teaching and learn ing that occurs in one's library and one's community, and that participat ing libraries and librarians are building their capacity to meet the challenges inherent in the idea of the teaching library. While the experience of a gen eration of instructional improvement experts may inform both how one chooses to pursue one's own continu ing education, as well as the range of resources and programs provided to library staff, it is important to remem ber that ""there is no single best way to improve teaching.""31 Each of the mod els discussed in this article will be the ",1385,1546
