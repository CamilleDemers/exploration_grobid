The Human Library is an advanced method designed to promote dialogue, reduce prejudices and encourage understanding. The paper aims to present the means of Human Library and its history and expansion, points out the Human Library is a new way of share the Information and elaborates the advantage and role of human library in tacit knowledge transfer and sharing in the Digital World.
",2019,Library Journal,,"Introduction:
The Human Library is an international organization and movement that first started in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2000 with the aim to challenge prejudice against social contact among people. Similar to how a traditional library works, the Human Library participants can be checked out, at which point they engage themselves in conversations and share stories with the public. The Human Library Organization is currently active in over 60 countries. The organization was founded in Copenhagen in 2000, when a series of living books were created for a festival run by 'Stop the Violence'. The first permanent Human Library was established in Lismore, Australia in 2006.
History of Human Library:
Once upon a time in Copenhagen, Denmark. There was a young and idealistic youth organization called ""Stop The Violence"". This non-governmental youth movement was self-initiated by the youngsters Dany Abergel, Asma Mouna, Christoffer Erichsen and Ronni Abergel from Copenhagen after a mutual friend was stabbed in the nightlife (1993). The brutal attack on their friend, who luckily survived, made the group decide to try and do something about the problem and to spread awareness and use peer group education to mobilize Danish youngsters against violence. In a few years the organization had 30.000 members all over the country.
Human Library in India:
Remember when we reported on Harshad Fad's brilliant initiative on starting India's first Human Library in Hyderabad? It isn't a very complicated concept, where instead of borrowing a book you can borrow a human being for 20 minutes and hear their story, dispelling prejudices and leaving the participants with a wider perspective. Delhi's first Human Library initiative might help us find that human connection once more. Delhi's first Human Library event took place on Sunday, June 18 2017 between 2 PM and 7 PM at Innov8 Co-working Space, Connaught Place. Each participant chooses from 11 Human Books, curated by the organizers in the last few weeks.
Meaning of Human Library:
The human Library is an International equalities movement based on a concept that facilitates conversation that can challenge prejudice and promote cohesion. The Human Library Organization is established in Demark, with an affiliated organisation, Human Library UK, based in Norfolk. The Human Library provides an opportunities to those people who have faced prejudice to be ""Human Book"" The titles of the Books acknowledge the prejudices the individuals have faced in their life, in the , hope that it may provoke a potential prejudice in the Reader (visitor). During a Human Library event visitor can pick one of these titles and engage in conversation with their chosen Book for up to thirty minutes.
The Human Library provides a safe and accessible way for people to explore the diversity of their community, and understand how prejudice can affect a wide number of people with whom they share their community. It encourages the Books and the Readers to discuss their commonalities and differences through a respectful conversation where often their assumptions and prejudices are challenged. The structure of the Human Library makes it possible for Readers to ask questions they may ordinarily be afraid/hesitate to ask, thus getting an opportunity to learn about each other's and Our Own attitudes and behaviours.
Why Run a Human Library?
A Human Library tackles prejudices, brings different people together and creates social capital. The format is a simple and very effective way to bring people together and create good will and understanding. If your organization works with people, who have experienced prejudice, you can collaborate with other organizations to create a Human Library. We have found that people who have been books found the experience Very enjoyable and have been keen to take part again. A Human Library gives people a chance to speak for themselves and know that they are helping to others to tackle prejudice. You cannot run a themed Human Library, for example, an event focusing on faith or sexuality The strength of a Human Library is that it covers variety of prejudices that people may face.
The most important element of the Human Library methodology is providing Readers with a choice of Books, that they can that it borrows, and it empowers them to ask the questions that they want to ask. By providing this choice, Readers are more likely to borrow other Books at the event, and are therefore are more likely to borrow someone that they would otherwise avoid making a social contact with.
If organization has a venue you can offer your space for free to the groups to come together and have a Human Library. You can also create your own Human Library by collaborating with other community organizations, often partners will have a clear idea of. who would be the confident one and enjoy being a book.
If your organization deals with conflicts between different groups you may wish to run a Human Library event to bring people together and support them to learn about each other. Again, this event cannot be themed.
Who can organize a Human Library?
A Human Library can be organized by anyone, who understands the importance of challenging the stereotypes, and prejudice that often leads to stigma and discrimination, and the one who wants to promote the respect for difference and diversity in their community. Human Libraries can be organized by a group of individuals or an organization/institution. Events are presented by public libraries, student groups, universities, high schools, colleges, festivals, nongovernmental organizations, public authorities and private partners. However, permission is needed from the HLO.
What is a Human Book?
A Human Library is an event that aims to create dialogue and understanding between people. Individuals volunteer as human 'books' and participants in the event can 'read' the bookmeaning they would have a one on one conversation with the volunteer and share in a dialogue about that individual's experience. 'Books' are volunteers from all walks of life who have experienced discrimination based on race, religion, sexual preference, class, gender identity, sex, age, lifestyle choices, disability and other aspects of their life. The Human Library provides the opportunity for the community to share and understand the experiences of others in their Community.
Conclusion:
Human Library enables readers to ask the questions they have always wanted to ask; while books are given the opportunity to share stories about their personal experiences in a safe and friendly environment. This allows individual to actively contribute to building inclusive communities of understanding. People come from various backgrounds would talk with each other, such as the police officer sitting there speaking with the youth activist, the politician in discussions with the graffiti writer and the football fan in deep chat with the feminist. Human Library would promote understanding between people of different social backgrounds in communication, breaking the barriers between the population and increasing the social cohesion. The idea is to introduce people to a collection of individuals who come from different walks of life and realities compared to their own. It's an attempt to promote diversity and share a broad range of views and opinions all within a context of respect and intellectual curiosity.",1366,1510

Human Library (HL) is a nonprofit community event aimed at increasing awareness and reduction of prejudice toward stigmatized groups in the society. HL implements an unusual methodology in the format of a pretend 'library' where HL attendants so-called 'Readers' engage in short, face-to-face, direct contact with so-called 'Books' who are real individuals from various stigmatized social groups. Although HL has been widely used in various contexts since 2000's and is recommended as the best practice of integration by European Commission, empirical research testing its effectiveness is limited. Our study presented the findings from four consecutive HL events conducted from 2016 to 2019 in Turkey (total N ¼ 534). Including various control groups, we tested the effectiveness of HL as a direct intergroup contact intervention on affective (trust, empathy), cognitive (knowledge), and behavioral (e.g., willingness to talk to outgroup members) aspects of outgroup attitudes. Findings demonstrated that while overall outgroup attitudes became more positive after HL attendance, unlike merely participating in the event or not attending HL, actual contact ('Reading a Book'), in particular, improved attitudes toward the target groups. While supporting the overall benefits of HL methodology as a contact intervention, our study demonstrated that HL may be more effective on certain dimensions of attitudes. Practical implications and possible limitations of HL, as well as perspectives for future research were discussed.

Prejudice and discrimination still constitute one of the critical barriers for the development of fully functioning, integrated societies. The last fifty years of intergroup relationship literature have been devoted to search for effective prejudice reduction mechanisms among which intergroup contact has been a particularly useful strategy to improve intergroup attitudes and behaviors (Allport, 1954;Pettigrew, 1997). While an extensive meta-analysis of over 500 studies demonstrated intergroup contact to be negatively associated with prejudice, especially when it satisfies various conditions such as equal status and institutional support (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), effective direct contact interventions are still relatively rare given the practical difficulties of implementing such contact between different group members (Dovidio et al., 2011). The current study tests the effectiveness of a direct intergroup contact intervention, Human Library (HL), which is a nonprofit community event that aims to reduce prejudice and discrimination against stigmatized group members in the society. Using an unusual methodology developed by Danish activists in 2000 (Human Library Organization, 2019), HL functions as a pretend 'library' in which visitors of HL ('Readers') meet the members of stigmatized groups ('Books') for short fixed-time face-to-face live conversations in small groups ('Reading Sessions'). Hence, during the event, participants engage in direct intergroup contact with 'Books', who are real persons from various stigmatized groups such as ex sex-workers, people with HIVþ, LGBTI, homeless and people with mental illnesses. Here, we present the results from four consecutive HL interventions conducted in a university campus setting in Turkey (Istanbul) between 2016 and 2019.
Intergroup contact theory
Since its introduction by Allport (1954), Intergroup Contact Theory has been an influential theory with the premise that intergroup contact between different group members can battle prejudice and improve intergroup relationships. Both correlational and experimental evidence has shown intergroup contact to promote positive attitudes and behavioral intentions toward a wide range of highly stigmatized groups including LGBTI group members (Healy et al., 2017;Herek & Glunt, 1993), physically disabled people (Armstrong et al., 2016), mentally ill (Giacobbe et al., 2013), refugees (Cameron et al., 2006), and people with HIV (Schiff et al., 2003). Further metaanalytic findings have demonstrated both contact and friendships that cross group boundaries to be associated with reduced prejudice across various samples and contexts (Davies et al., 2011;Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), via decreased intergroup anxiety, increased empathy and perspective-taking, as well as increased knowledge about the target outgroup (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008). Other meta-analytic findings (Miles & Crisp, 2014;Zhou et al., 2019) accumulated evidence for the effectiveness of even indirect forms of contact such as extended contact (knowledge or observation of ingroup members' contact, Wright et al., 1997) or imagined contact (mental simulation of a positive contact scenario, Turner et al., 2007).
While initial theoretical assumptions in contact theory suggested that contact with an outgroup member at the individual level is likely to generalize across situations and to the whole target outgroup, known as primary transfer effects (Pettigrew, 1997;Pettigrew, 1998), more recent research has focused on contact's secondary transfer effects whereby contact with an outgroup member generalizes to other outgroups, not even involved in the direct contact situation (Pettigrew, 2009). This process often occurs as a result of ingroup re-appraisal during intergroup contact (e.g., Tausch et al., 2010), which consequently creates a more tolerant, open-minded, and flexible view of group membership in individuals (e.g., Hodson et al., 2018;Pettigrew, 1997). Additional benefits of intergroup contact include the improvement of various skills such as intercultural competence, acceptance of others, and critical thinking (e.g., Bagci et al., 2019;Hurtado, 2001), suggesting intergroup contact among youth to be a critical element of liberal education (Hodson et al., 2018).
While recent research trends in the field of intergroup contact have devoted growing attention to indirect contact strategies such as extended contact (Vezzali et al., 2014) as more practical strategies that reduce prejudice, other research shows real-life (outside lab) contact experiences to produce stronger prejudice-reduction effects (Lemmer & Wagner, 2015) and direct experiences to have more permanent impacts on attitudes compared to indirect experiences (Fazio et al., 1983). Direct contact experiences outside the lab have been formerly categorized as contact meetings (e.g., Maoz, 2000) or cooperative learning programs (Cook, 2000) where people from different backgrounds are engaged in direct interaction including structured intergroup dialogues (Lemmer & Wagner, 2015). Nevertheless, structured direct contact programs that target the reduction of prejudice specifically against stigmatized groups by creating friendly, non-official, and intimate intergroup contexts are still relatively less common.
Moreover, despite strong meta-analytic findings indicating the benefits of intergroup contact (e.g., Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), other research has shown several criticisms to the contact theory by highlighting, for example, the focus on the rarified conditions under which contact would promote intergroup attitudes (Dixon et al., 2005) or underlining the possibility of negative intergroup contact which may occur naturally in conflictual intergroup contexts, putting a strain on the overall effectiveness of intergroup contact (Paolini et al., 2010). Therefore, the current study aims to contribute to this literature by testing the effectiveness of HL as a practical and structured intergroup contact strategy, which is likely to provide a comfortable interaction setting for the occurence of a positive intergroup contact experience.
Human library methodology
HL is an internationally organized event and a learning platform which is dedicated to promote diversity and tolerance in the society using a unique methodology that allows people from different social groups and backgrounds to communicate with each other in an informal and safe environment. HL was initiated by a non-governmental organization 'Stop the Violence' in Denmark in 2000 (Human Library Organization, 2019) and caused a great resonance in press. Since then, HL has been held in more than 80 countries around the world. In 2003, the Council of Europe became a supporter of the development and promotion of HL programs. The European Commissions Handbook on Integration for policymakers and practitioners recommends HL as the best practice of integration, encouraging EU member states to use this methodology and supporting local initiatives organizing HL events.
HL format imitates the work of a normal public library and uses a similar terminology; 'Books' are humans, who are real members of the stigmatized social groups that often experience stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination, and who are willing to share their personal history, experience and knowledge, and to respond honestly to the questions of 'Readers'. The examples of 'Books' include Transexual, Prison Guardian, HIVþ, Homeless, Schizofrenic, Exsex worker, Pedophilia victim, Drag Queen, Exprisoner, Gay, Dwarf, or Refugee (See Supplementary Materials for the full book lists from 2016 to 2019). While selected 'Books' often include worldwide stigmatized groups, they may also vary across country depending on which social groups experience prejudice in different societies (e.g., while a Muslim person can be considered a Book title in EU, but not in Turkey; a Single Mother is more likely to be a Book title in Turkey, but not in EU). 'Readers' are attendees (participants) of the Human Library event, who are willing to interact and get first-source information about specific stigmatized social groups. 'Reading Sessions' are short-term ($20-40 minutes), face-toface conversations between the 'Books' and 'Readers'. These informal and constructive dialogues between members of different social groups such as professional, religious and ethnic groups, are likely to help people challenge their prejudices and to raise the level of understanding and acceptance in society.
Human library as a direct contact strategy
We conceptualized HL as an effective direct contact strategy promoting attitudes and behaviors toward stigmatized group members for various reasons. First of all, contact in HL satisfies some of the original contact conditions suggested by Allport (1954), including social norms of equality, and a friendly contact setting. In addition, HL event organized at Sabanci University satisfied the condition of institutional support; since our event was organized in a university campus, contact between the participants and stigmatized group members was qualified with positive social norms about diversity and tolerance. HL participants were, therefore, aware of the fact that the university provided space, advertisement, food and transport for the 'Books'. Moreover, the study was conducted by two faculty members from the Psychology Program and included the collaborative work of CIP (Civic Involvement Projects) division at the university, thereby meaning that the institutional setting encouraged the occurrence of the event. Moreover, HL satisfies the condition of cooperation whereby both parties gather together in order to build a positive intergroup dialogue around the stigmatized persons' personal accounts. Although the conversations are not structured, participants are encouraged to engage in respectful and positive intergroup contact. HL rules are explicitly stated and signed by the participants (for example, 'Readers' are required to return the 'Book' in the same psychological and physical condition and are asked: 'Never harm a Book!', see Supplementary Materials for HL rules). On the other hand, HL events include stigmatized individuals who are typical representatives of their social group, thereby increasing the salience of group membership which is an important facilitator of contact effects' generalization (Brown & Hewstone, 2005). Furthermore, intergroup contact in HL involves stigmatized group members who are willing to share their experiences, and thereby fosters intergroup self-disclosure and intimacy which have been previously demonstrated to promote intergroup contact effects (e.g., Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008;Turner et al., 2007). Such self-disclosure also encourages the learning process of the outgroup which is a potential mechanism whereby attitudes toward the other group change (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008). At the same time, the format of HL is similar to a 'pretend play' where individuals engage in the role of the 'Book' or the 'Reader', which can potentially facilitate an effective dialogue characterized by relatively lower levels of intergroup anxiety. Notably, desipte the pretend format, the inividuals who play the role of 'Books' are real stigmatized individuals, and the 'Reading Sessions' involve actual conversations about their real life experiences and feelings. Moreover, 'Books' in HL are members of stigmatized groups with whom participants do not usually have the opportunity to meet on a daily life basis or meet in a context that does not necessarily promote openness and tolerance. Therefore, HL is likely to provide high quality, intimate intergroup contact with members of stigmatized groups and thereby reduce initial prejudices toward these outgroup members.
Despite the popularity and promising opportunities of HL as a prejudice reduction intervention, there have been only few scientific attempts to test its effectiveness on the reduction of negative attitudes and behaviors (Blazhenkova & Aydın, 2014;Groyecka et al., 2019;Orosz et al., 2016). Previous empirical evidence that has been derived from an HL organized in Hungary (Orosz et al., 2016) demonstrated that contacting the Roma and LGBT in HL successfully decreased prejudice-related outcomes targeting these communities. In another study by Groyecka et al. (2019), HL attendance has been found to effectively reduce social distance toward religious minorities in Poland.
The current research aims to extend these previous studies in a number of ways. First, previous studies were conducted in Europe with only a few stigmatized groups, while we present data from Turkey which ranks relatively lower among various European countries in terms of tolerance (e.g., Berggren & Nilsson, 2013) and where egalitarian norms are less pronounced than in many Western countries (Kabasakal & Bodur, 1998). Especially since 1995, Turkey has been suggested to experience a shift toward more authoritarian ideologies, religiosity, and intolerance toward various groups such as homosexuals, drug addicts, and people with HIVþ (Yes ¸ilada & Noordijk, 2010) and an increase in politically religious values (Dixon et al., 2013) as well as conservatism (C ¸arkoǧlu & Kalaycioǧlu, 2009), which makes it an important socio-cultural context for interventions that target the reduction of prejudice against disadvantaged minority groups, since previous intergroup contact research shows contact interventions to function even more effectively in highly prejudicial contexts (e.g., West et al., 2015).
Second, unlike previous studies, we analyzed data from four consecutive years (2016-2019) 1 , including a relatively larger sample size, and targeted changes in attitudes toward a variety of stigmatized groups such as transexuals and ex-prisoners who are highly stigmatized in the society (e.g., Boag & Wilson, 2014). Third, we compared attitude change using various control groups (attending HL but not engaging in contact with the specific outgroup and not attending HL at all), which may contribute to the theoretical understanding of the contact theory by distinguishing the effects of mere exposure to diversity and actual intergroup contact. Fourth, we incorporated various aspects of outgroup attitudes, focusing on three dependent variables representing affective, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of attitudes; we included the level of knowledge about the target social group 'Books' belong to, since previous research has shown that knowledge-based contact interventions which include the exchange of information between different group members can combat prejudice against various stigmatized group members (Pinto-Foltz et al., 2011). Furthermore, we assessed two critical aspects of affective intergroup processes: outgroup trust and empathy, since previous research has shown both trust and empathy to be critical indicators of positive outgroup attitudes (e.g., Nadler & Liviatan, 2006;Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008). Finally, we investigated behavioral intentions toward the outgroup and measured the extent to which HL increases people's willingness to approach novel group members from the target outgroup. Although attitudes' predictive strength on the relevant behavior is dependent on various factors (Fazio, 1990), many times, it is practically not possible to measure the actual behavior such as contacting other outgroup members. When this is the case, it is common for researchers to rely on behavioral intentions as a driver of the actual behavior (Ajzen, 1991). Hence, we took such an approach and examined behavioral intentions that underline the motivational aspects of the contact behavior.
Human library procedure HL participants were recruited from different faculties through the advertisment of the HL project in campus (posters, websites, social media). Some of the participants also joined the event on site. There was no elligibility criteria for the participants, everyone was welcomed. 'Books', as stigmatized group individuals, were recruited through the the staff of Civic Involvement Projects division in the university, as well as social network of the researchers. We based our selection of 'Books' on culturally relevant social norms, taking into account both globally and locally stigmatized group members in the context, as well as the availability of the 'Books' in each year. We also aimed to keep our list dynamic each year, including different marginalized groups in the society to create more diversity (e.g., Anorexic, Drag Queen). The criteria of being a 'Book' included perceiving stigmatization based on the social group one belongs to, the willingness to openly share thier life experiences and knowledge regarding their stigmatized group, as well as an agreement with rules of HL. Most of these stigmatized groups members already attended HL events in our or other campuses or public places and upon agreement on their participation, they were provided guidelines about HL goals and format and received the HL materials (e.g., HL rules, FAQs, see Supplementary Materials).
Participants of HL signed the agreement with the HL rules and received Reading Cards when they arrived at the event site. At Book selection and scheduling area, they chose various group members to contact and reserved specific time slots (approximately 3-9 participants per 'Book'). Before the start of a contact session, participants met with a 'Librarian' (HL volunteer) who led them to the contact areas allocated to each session. Contact with a particular group member lasted 20 minutes and the participants were able to return to the scheduling area and continue contacting other individuals until the end of the event as they wished.
The attitudes were measured via paper and pencil (in 2016 and 2017) and online (in 2018 and 2019) surveys before and after the event. Participants received course credits for participation or did it voluntarily. In 2016 and 2017, during the registration, participants were offered the option to participate in research right before and after their contact and completed the pretest and posttest questionnaires at the site of the event, in a separate room. In all the cases, the surveys were anonymous.
Analytic strategy
Both pretests and posttests included questions targeting all different social categories involved in the project. Therefore, our initial analyses comprised the examination of change on the aggregated levels of prejudice across all the Books. Next, we reported more specific findings focusing on the two most popular groups of the year in order to test the effects of actual contact. These groups were decided post-hoc, allowing us to maintain a balanced sample size across participants who have contacted and who have not contacted the specific group members. We further computed the total number of 'Books' contacted, since engaging in contact with any outgroup may be related to improvements in attitudes toward the target outgroup due to the seconary transfer effect, which suggests that attitude improvement through contact with an outgroup member can generalize to attitudes toward other group members not involved in the contact situation (Pettigrew, 2009). Hence, it is possible that the more groups are contacted, the more the participants becomes tolerant toward non-contacted outgroups. Moreover, we took into account previous HL attendance, as it was possible that participants attended previous HL activities. In 2016 and 2017, we examined Time (pre vs. post) and Contact (contacted vs. did not contact) main effects, as well as their interactive effects, also accounting for the total number of 'Books' contacted and previous HL attendance. In 2018 and 2019, we additionally included a non-attendant group as a control group.
HL 2016

Method

Participants
HL in 2016 was organized at Sabanci University on the 28th November. A total of 106 students (13 Males, 93 Females, M age ¼ 21.33, SD ¼ 1.45) participated in both pretests and posttests. The majority of participants were from Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (57.1%), while the rest were from Faculty of Engineering (33.3%) and School of Management (9.5%).
Measures
The two most popular outgroups contacted were 'Exprisoner' (36 contacted and 70 did not contact) and 'HIVþ' (32 contacted and 74 did not contact). In the pretests, participants responded to demographic questions such as age, gender, faculty and next were given the attitude measures.
Unless otherwise indicated, all response scales ranged from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). We assessed knowledge about the target outgroup with a single item (""How much do you know about the members of the following social groups?""), affective outgroup evaluation combining outgroup trust and empathy items (""How much do you trust members of the following social groups?"" and ""How well you can understand the feelings of members of the following social groups?"", r ¼ .40 and .57, for Ex-prisoner's pre and post evaluation scale, respectively; r ¼ .37 and .51, for HIVþ' pre and post evaluation scale respectively), and behavioral intentions with a single item (""How probable is it that you will have close friendships with members of the following social groups?, ranging from 1¼ very low to 5 ¼ very high).
Results
The reliabilities of the generalized pre and posttest measures ranged between .91 and .96. The overall effects of HL attendance using the aggregated measures of knowledge, trust, empathy, and behavioral intentions can be found in Figure 1. HL attendants indicated higher levels of outgroup knowledge (d ¼ À.99); empathy (d ¼ À.56), and positive behavioral intentions (d ¼ À.33) from pretests to posttests, indicating strongest effects for outgroup knowledge. The change in outgroup trust was small (d ¼ À.12).
Contact with the 'ex-prisoner book'
There was a small to medium sized effect of Time on outgroup knowledge (g p 2 ¼ .04), showing knowledge about prisoners to increase over time. The main effect of Contact was smaller (g p 2 ¼ .03). However, there was a strong interaction between Time and Contact (g p 2 ¼ .21), such that only the ones who contacted the Ex-prisoner had increased outgroup knowledge from the pretest to the posttest. The difference between two time points or contact groups on affective outgroup evaluation was small (g p 2 ¼ .00 and g p 2 ¼ .01, respectively). There was, however, a medium to large interaction effect between Time and Contact (g p 2 ¼ .10), with participants who contacted the Exprisoner group member displaying a greater increase in the positive evaluation of the relevant outgroup compared to the ones who did not engage in contact. Regarding behavioral intentions, Time effects were minimal (g p 2 ¼ .00), while Contact effects were notable (g p 2 ¼ .04), suggesting the contact group to display more positive behavioral intentions compared to the non-contact group. An interaction effect was also observed (g p 2 ¼ .11), indicating the participants who contacted this person to show an increased friendship potential with ex-prisoners compared to the ones who did not contact this outgroup member.
Contact with the 'HIV þ book'
There was a small effect of Time on knowledge about people with HIVþ, with no meaningful change over time (g p 2 ¼ .02). However, Contact effect was noticeable (g p 2 ¼ .11), showing participants who contacted the HIV þ group member to report greater knowledge compared to the ones who did not contact this person. An interaction effect was also detectable (g p 2 ¼ .09); the contact group gained greater knowledge about people with HIV þ compared to the ones in the non-contact group. The effect of Time on outgroup evaluation was small (g p 2 ¼ .01), but Contact had a notable effect (g p 2 ¼ .13), showing the contact behavior to improve the evaluation of people with HIVþ. We further observed a medium sized interaction (g p 2 ¼ .06), indicating people who only contacted this outgroup member to report a more positive evaluation of the outgroup over time. The main effect of Time on behavioral intentions was small (g p 2 ¼ .01), but the main effect of Contact was medium-sized (g p 2 ¼ .05), indicating that contacting the 'HIV þ Book' improved positive behavioral intentions toward people with HIVþ. However, the interaction between Time and Contact was negligible (g p 2 ¼ .00). Figure 2 displays interaction effects concerning contact with the two group members.
Discussion
Findings demonstrated that attendance to HL increased the aggregated levels of outgroup knowledge, empathy, and positive behavioral intentions toward stigmatized group members. However, we failed to find a change in terms of outgroup trust, which is potentially a relatively more stable variable compared to the other variables. Confirming this, previous research has indicated that it is often challenging to build and maintain intergroup trust, especially in difficult intergroup contexts that involve high levels of prejudice (C ¸elebi et al., 2014). In addition, we demonstrated that HL was an effective way of promoting positive attitudes toward two distinct stigmatized groups in the society. While research in Turkey has not previously focused on prejudice levels toward exprisoners or individuals with HIVþ, empirical research from other socio-cultural contexts indicate both offenders and people with HIV þ to report a high level of discrimination in their social environment (Boag & Wilson, 2014;Genberg et al., 2009;Kyprianides et al., 2019;Malcolm et al., 1998) and that direct contact may improve attitudes toward these groups (e.g., Schiff et al., 2003). Therefore, confirming previous correlational studies, we showed that HL may be an effective strategy to fight people's outgroup prejudices. We obtained the highest effect sizes in relation to knowledge about the outgroup, which suggests that one of the prominent ways HL works on intergroup processes may be the cognitive route where participants' strongly held negative stereotypes are challenged (e.g., Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008).
HL 2017

Method
Participants HL 2017 was organized on the 20th November at Sabanci University. A total of 86 Sabanci University participants (M age ¼ 21.07, SD ¼ 1.50; 25 Males and 60 Females, 1 Unknown) completed pre and posttest measurements before and after the organization at the site of the event. Participants were mostly from the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (47.4%), and the remaining sample belonged to the Faculty of Engineering (37.5%) and the School of Management (16.7%).
Measures
The two most popular group members in 2017 were: 'Ex-prisoner' (32 contacted and 54 did not contact) and 'Ex-sex worker' (37 contacted and 49 did not contact). All response scales ranged from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). We used the same measures as in 2016, including knowledge about the outgroup (""How much do you know about the members of the following social groups?"") and outgroup evaluation (encompassing empathy: ""How much you can understand the feelings of the following social groups?"" and trust: ""How much do you trust members of the following social groups?""; r ¼ .33 and r ¼ .64, for the pre and posttest measures of the Ex-prisoner, respectively, and r ¼ .23 and r ¼ .45 for the pre and posttest measures of the Ex-sex worker, respectively), except behavioral intentions.
Results
The reliabilities of the generalized pre and posttest measures ranged between .85 and .95. Changes from pretest to posttest measures regarding generalized outgroup knowledge, trust, and empathy were presented in Figure 3. We observed an increase in outgroup knowledge (d ¼ À.61), as well as empathy (d ¼ À.53), indicating a medium level effect sizes. However, there was no major change from pretests to posttests in outgroup trust (d ¼ .05).
Contact with the 'ex-prisoner book' Time had a small to medium sized effect on outgroup knowledge (g p 2 ¼ .04). The main effect of Contact was larger (g p 2 ¼ .11), such that the ones who contacted the Ex-prisoner group member showed greater knowledge about this group compared to the ones who did not contact this person. There was a strong interaction between Time and Contact (g p 2 ¼ .36); only 'Readers' of this 'Book' displayed an increase in knowledge over time. Furthermore, outgroup evaluation at the posttest was higher than the outgroup evaluation at the pretest (g p 2 ¼ .05). We also detected a small-medium difference between the ones who contacted and the ones who did not on outgroup evaluation (g p 2 ¼ .04). Moreover, the interaction between Time and Contact was strong (g p 2 ¼ .26); the participants who had contact with the Ex-prisoner group member showed an increase in the positive evaluation of ex-prisoners, while the ones who did not have contact with this 'Book' did not show such a change.
Contact with the 'ex-sex worker book' The difference in outgroup knowledge at two time points was small (g p 2 ¼ .001), whereas participants displayed substantially different outgroup knowledge across contact conditions (g p 2 ¼ .20), showing the ones contacting the Ex-sex worker person to report greater knowledge about ex-sex workers compared to the ones who did not participate in the contact session. There was also a strong interaction between Time and Contact (g p 2 ¼ .24). Accordingly, only the ones who contacted the Ex-sex worker had a significant and strong increase in outgroup knowledge. Time did not have a meaningful effect on the evaluation of sex-workers (g p 2 ¼ .00), whereas Contact did (g p 2 ¼ .05); the ones who contacted this group member reported a more positive evaluation of the target outgroup compared to the ones who did not engage in contact. Moreover, only the ones who contacted this 'Book' showed an increase over time in the positive evaluation of ex-sex workers (g p 2 ¼ .26). Figure 4 demonstrates adjusted means and standard errors for pre and posttest variables and presents interaction effects.
Discussion
Findings of HL 2017 replicated the results of HL 2016 indicating HL to be an effective intervention to improve outgroup knowledge and evaluation. Confirming the findings obtained in 2016, we found outgroup empathy and knowledge (but not trust) to increase after HL participation. Similar to 2016 HL results, outgroup trust was already high at two time points, and did not change much, which may be due to a ceiling effect on this variable. We further found strong interaction effects both in relation to a previously tested stigmatized group (Ex-prisoner) and to a new group (Ex-sex worker). Like ex-prisoners, sex workers are also face-to-face with many overt discrimination events including abusive and violent actions as a part of their daily life experiences (Rhodes et al., 2008) and our findings showed strong evidence that HL can function as an effective prejudice reduction intervention by promoting knowledge and positive evaluation of various stigmatized groups in the society.  HL 2018 
Materials
We focused on contact with the 'Transexual' (24 contacted and 63 did not contact) and the 'Ex-sex worker' (32 contacted and 55 did not contact) individuals as members of the most popular stigmatized groups. 2  The same materials used in HL 2016 were used, including outgroup evaluation formed of trust and empathy (r ¼ .43 and .40, for pre and postmeasures of Ex-Sex worker, respectively; r ¼ .29 and .47, for pre and postmeasures of Transexual, respectively) and behavioral intentions 3 by asking participants the degree to which they would be willing to talk to the representatives of the groups contact persons belonged to (""How much are you willing to talk to the representatives of the following social groups?""). All response scales ranged from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much).
Results
All reliabilities for the generalized measures ranged between .90 and .96. Preliminary analyses on initial levels of generalized outgroup measures demonstrated that HL attendants and non-attendants did not differ from each other. Generalized attitude change from pretests to posttests were presented in Figure 5 and demonstrated HL attendants, but not non-attendants, to report small to medium sized differences in terms of outgroup trust, empathy, and positive behavioral intentions toward outgroups after HL (See Supplementary Analyses for detailed analyses).
Contact with the 'transexual book' An initial examination of Time and Contact effects on outgroup evaluation demonstrated these effects to be small (g p 2 ¼ .00 and .002, respectively). However, we observed an interaction between Time and Contact (g p 2 ¼ .07), such that only the ones who attended HL and contacted the Transexual individual showed a greater evaluation of transexuals over time. Similarly, Time and Contact did not have notable ef",6826,7694

Educators focused on promoting intercultural dialogue and the protection of human rights are frequently faced with the challenge to come up with something innovative, something that can attract pupils and students attention. The Human library is considered to be an innovative method, as well as a safe space for a dialogue, where different topics are discussed openly between Human books and their ""readers"". In Slovakia Human libraries have been operating in the youth sector for fourteen years, however there has hardly been any cooperation between their organizers (NGO's) and formal educational institutions. Therefore, this study reflects on this gap and examines Human library as a teaching strategy for achieving cooperation between formal and non-formal educational institutions and simultaneously engages pupils and students personally in challenging prejudice and stereotypes. A qualitative research design was used for this study. All participants of Human libraries (primary and secondary school teachers, university teacher trainee educators, youth workers, pupils and students) were asked to fill out an anonymous feedback reflecting their attitude to the Human library and also to the ""read"" Human books. We gathered data from seven Human libraries around Slovakia (Banská Bystrica, Bratislava, Košice, Nitra, Prešov, Trenčín and Žilina) from more than 650 respondents. These Human libraries brought together people who would not have normally met, engaged them in conversations and provided them an innovative strategy useful for formal and non-formal education, as well as for cooperation of formal and non-formal educational institutions to increase respect for difference and otherness. The results of feedback content analysis demonstrate how Human libraries engage pupils and students in the process of countering prejudice, increasing respect for diversity and promoting human rights.
",2020-08-27,Procedia -Social and Behavioral Sciences,IATED,"INTRODUCTION
Over the past several years, an increasing enthusiasm for innovative teaching approaches that combine formal and non-formal education has been observed. Many researchers and university teacher trainee educators have discussed the need for increasing application of non-formal education at schools and universities [1][2][3]. Werquin [4] explains the current increasing interest in the non-formal learning by the fact that this mode of learning mostly reproduces real world situations. In other words, Erich [5] is saying that education cannot be limited to school, but must encompass all dimensions of existence, contribute to the development of individual personality to help him understand his place in society. The educators focused on promoting intercultural dialogue and protection of human rights are frequently faced with this challenge to come up with something innovative, something that can attract pupils and students attention and simultaneously to help them learn from each other's experiences. The Human library, in particular, is considered to be an innovative non-formal method, it is being referred to as a safe space for dialogue, where different topics are discussed openly between Human books and their ""readers"".
History of the Human Library in Slovakia
The Human library was founded in Copenhagen, Denmark, by a young and idealistic youth organisation called ""Stop the Violence"" in 2000, with an objective to break down barriers in communities and give voice to those who have faced discrimination [6][7]. Ever since, the Human library has grown intensely and has gained global popularity in countries such as Australia [8], Canada [9], China [10], and the United States [11]. In 2007, the Human library was launched also in Slovakia for the very first time. Youth workers from IUVENTA (Slovak Youth Institute) learned about the project and decided to organise a Human library event during the International day of Human rights. This event turned out to be a huge success in Slovakia [12]. Since then, IUVENTA (Slovak Youth Institute) has hosted Human library every year and the activity has become a major attraction for youth, NGOs and many other institutions. Over the last ten years, other NGOs have also begun to explore the concept of Human library, and the possibilities it offers. Nowadays Human libraries are organised in Slovakia mainly by NGOs, such as: Eduma, Milan Simecka Foundation and Amnesty International Slovakia [13].
Concept of Human Library
A Human library is an event in which ""readers"" gather to listen to ""Human books"" tell personal stories about specific topics [14]. It is a public event aimed at reducing stereotypes and prejudices, in the form of an interactive, contact-based intervention. It employs the logic of a regular library yet with readers ""borrowing"" Human books [15]. Human books are people who have unique stories to tell: they have experienced discrimination and prejudice, hardships, and significant life challenges [14]. The ""reader"" of the Human library can be anybody who is ready to talk with his or her own prejudice and stereotype. In the Human library, Books cannot only speak, but they are able to reply to the readers' questions, and the Books can even ask questions and learn themselves [16]. Some human libraries involve only one person ""reading"" a Human book at a given time [6], but usually include groups of ""readers"" listening to a Human book. Human libraries represent a new way of building and sharing community knowledge, which works to enable people to learn lived experience from their fellow community members [17].
Based on these facts, the present study aims (1) to examine Human library as a teaching strategy for achieving cooperation between formal and non-formal educational institutions, (2) to receive and analyse a valuable and authentic feedback from primary and secondary school teachers, university teacher trainee educators, youth workers, pupils and students to help university educators identify the areas of strengths and weaknesses, of the applied innovative non-formal method (Human library) in formal education, and (3) to engage pupils and students in challenging prejudice and stereotypes.
METHODOLOGY
The study described in this paper was carried out within seven Human libraries in Banská Bystrica, Bratislava, Košice, Nitra, Prešov, Trenčín and Žilina (cities of Slovakia) during school year 2018-2019. These Human libraries were organized in cooperation of two different institutions: The Constantine the Philosopher University (CPU, formal educational institution) and IUVENTA -Slovak Youth Institute (non-formal educational institution). IUVENTA -Slovak Youth Institute was chosen for cooperation due to its long history of Human libraries organization. In accordance with each Human library organization, there were also primary and secondary schools from chosen cities participating.
A total number of 699 participants who attended these events were given the same instructions. Each participant was allowed to borrow maximum three Human books while being given 30 minutes tops to speak with them in groups of up to ten people. The ""Human book titles"" to be borrowed were the following: a hearing-impaired person, a person with a visual impairment, a person with Asperger's Syndrome, a disabled, wheelchair-bound person, a girl with eating disorder, a mother of child with Down syndrome, a homeless person, a Roma athlete, a Somalia refugee, Syrian Civil War refugees and a person of a Jewish descent.
At the end of Human libraries events, organizers were asked to fill in an anonymous feedback reflecting their attitude to the experience with the cooperation between formal and non-formal educational institutions within the frame of Human libraries. In addition, Human library ""readers"" were also asked to fill in an anonymous voluntary feedback, to be able to provide an in-depth insight into participants' thoughts and feelings after attending the Human library and ""reading"" Human books.
The data obtained from anonymous feedbacks from all participants (organizers, pupils and students) were conducted a thematic analysis and obtained data are summarized by means of descriptive statistics.
RESULTS

The Experience with the Cooperation of Formal and Non-formal Educational Institutions within Organizing Human Libraries
In order to better understand the process of organizing a Human library, we asked the Human library organizers (primary and secondary school teachers, university teacher trainee educators and youth workers) to fill in an anonymous feedback after each Human library. Questions in feedback were focused on evaluation of the experience with the cooperation of formal and non-formal educational institutions within organizing Human libraries, and improving the methodology for a potential re-run of the event. The answers from anonymous feedbacks were conducted a thematic analysis and the main findings are presented in the following Table 1 and Table 2. 
The participants personal opinion of the Human libraries and Human books
In addition, pupils and students were also asked to fill in an anonymous voluntary feedback. They were asked to write about their personal opinion of these Human libraries in general. Moreover they could leave the personal message for ""read"" Human books.
Throughout seven Human libraries, the organisation team received 373 feedback forms from all kind of readers. It means, that 53% of all respondents filled in an anonymous voluntary feedback (Table 3). Surprisingly we noticed that there is no negative statement about visited Human libraries and ""read"" Human books. Considering this fact, our study show that there is, in general, a strongly positive attitude towards the Human libraries. In the following section, the impact of Human libraries and Human books on ""readers"" is described. We noticed that the easiest and effective way to describe the impact is to present some opinions, feelings, impression from ""readers"" about Human library.
From feedback forms, six major categories of statements (see Graph 1) have been determined, ranging on the scale from general (focused on the human book story, obtaining new knowledge, human library atmosphere) to more self-focused (inspiration for life, self-discovery in the human book story, personal message/wish).
Graph 1. Categories of statements.
Graph 1 shows that the statement focused on the Human book story was written by 32% of the respondents, in their feedbacks were mentioned:
Personal message/wish Self-discovery in the Human book story
Inspiration for life
The Human library atmosphere
New knowledge
The Human book story
-""(Name of Human book) fascinated me with her courage in choosing to become a mother, even though she knew that her son would be born with Down's syndrome.""
-""It struck me that during the war in Iraq, the children could not go to school and that they could not play outside.""
-""I am surprised that (Name of Human book) has positive experiences with people in Slovakia and does not meet with manifestations of racism and racial discrimination.""
-""I liked the whole story, but what surprised me the most was that (Name of Human book) communicated with her boyfriend for three years only with a pen and paper.""
Additionally, 13% of the respondents thought that they learned something new from Human books:
-""I learned interesting stuff from history of The Second world war and Jewish holocaust.""
-""I learned to listen better.""
-""I learned what the blind people dream of.""
-""I learned how children with Asperger's syndrome behave and that they can be successful. I was surprised that Lionel Messi has also Asperger's syndrome.""
The survey revealed that 13% of the respondents stated that they really liked the Human library atmosphere:
-""Human books were really open and I felt I was having a real discussion with friends.""
-""I liked that the stories were uncensored and we were discussing with Human book in small group without teachers.""
-""The Human library had very personal character. It was really visible that Human books had talked about real life experience and not about something learned from books.""
-""I liked that I could choose the Human book and story, which I would like to listen. Nobody forced me to change my mind.""
Furthermore, 30% of all respondents stated that the Human book story is inspiration for their future life:
-""Her story inspired me not to look with regret at people with disabilities, but to look at them as non-disabled people.""
-""So far I haven't been grateful for what I have. I have to change my mind.""
-""To this day I have been afraid of foreigners, since the meeting with (Name of Human book), I wish to meet more people like her.""
-""(Name of Human book) helps others despite her unfavourable destiny. I decided to become a volunteer.""
6% of the respondents revealed that they discovered themselves in the ""read"" Human book story:
-""My father has also a drinking problem, therefore I prefer to live in the school dormitory. This story gave me the energy to go on.""
-""I also solve the same dilemma like (Name of Human book). I have Hungarian nationality and I live in Slovakia. Sometimes I feel confused, because I don't know who I truly am and where I belong.""
-""Nobody from my classmates knows that I am fighting with eating disorders. It was hard to overcome my fear and chose the Human book with the same problems. I am proud of myself that I did it, she motivated me to love myself as I am.""
Finally, 6% of pupils and students decided to leave the personal message for ""read"" Human books:
-""You are doing the right thing. I will also spread your message, because it has the power to change our future. 
CONCLUSIONS
Education of pupils and students with special needs has gone through a long way in Slovakia; from special education to integrated education and from integrated education to inclusive education. Researchers from CPU in Nitra were studying different aspects of inclusive education and their researches were focused on the integration of pupils with special needs to schools and school clubs [18] and also to tertiary education [19]. Dufeková et al. [20] were also studying competence of university educators in context of inclusive education. Although, the idea of inclusive education is still defeated due to lack of proper attitude and sensitivity on the part of university educators, teachers, parents, community and also pupils and students.
Mathew & Jha [21] state, that to be able to deal with all the challenges of inclusive education, intercultural dialogue and protection of human rights is necessary to sensitize people and focus on providing education of three H -Head, Heart and Hand, especially education of the heart which is related to feeling aspect. However formal educational institutions are rigid in terms of time, curriculum, learning place and evaluation. Knowing the limitations of the formal system it is necessary that nonformal mode of education provide their support.
Based on these facts we tried in this study to examine Human library as a teaching strategy for achieving cooperation between formal and non-formal educational institutions and to sensitized university teacher trainee educators, teachers, youth workers, pupils and students.
Our results showed that formal and also non-formal educational institutions benefited from contributing to the Human library organisation. Making connections proved beneficial in line with the traditional goals of the Human library. In meeting, talking to, and recruiting Human books and ""readers"" into Human libraries all participated organisations were able to overcome social distances and make functional connections between each other. Also ""readers"" of Human books enjoyed the feeling of sharing experiences and knowledge that could instil a positive change in them. By the feedbacks analysis the increased knowledge, understanding, and self-reflexivity among participants were demonstrated.
Based on all our findings we can conclude that the education is the foundation and catalyst for changing the state of human rights protection in the world. However, formal educational institution need effective materials and tools, which they can use to incorporate human rights in their curriculum.
Recognizing this, we really recommend to bring Human libraries to formal education. However, formal educational institutions must not forget that the trained Human Books, non-formal atmosphere, and youth workers from non-formal educational institutions are fundamental for successful implementation of Human libraries in education. The cooperation between formal and non-formal educational institutions in organizing Human libraries gives to university educators and teachers a possibility to bring the concepts of human rights to education and make them a reality in the hearts, minds and actions of those who are ready to ""read"".",2859,3186
10.3390/ijerph17093029,,Kwan 2020,True,Chi Kin Kwan,A Qualitative Inquiry into the Human Library Approach: Facilitating Social Inclusion and Promoting Recovery,"
The key to the successful social inclusion of people recovering from mental illness is mutual understanding with other community members. To promote such social inclusion, the human library approach has been adopted by a group of practitioners based in Hong Kong. Through a review of this community mental health initiative, this study explores the relevance and usefulness of this approach in a mental health setting. A collaborative inquiry-based research method was adopted to explore the human library approach in practice. A practitioner inquiry group was conducted with four social workers and three peer support workers to examine their experience of running the human library. Thematic analysis and member checks were used to identify important themes. The practitioners' reports of their experiences showed that the human library is well suited to facilitating social inclusion and promoting mental health recovery. Community members and people in recovery can benefit from participating in a human library, and the two sides can become connected through mutual understanding. However, possible risks for people in recovery were also identified. This study argues that the human library deserves consideration as an approach to facilitating social inclusion and promoting recovery. Its effectiveness and benefits are evident, especially compared with large-scale one-way intervention approaches. A clinical practice manual should be developed to inform future practitioners of the value of the human library approach in mental health settings.
",2020-04-27,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,MDPI AG,"Introduction
The human library approach was developed as a community intervention strategy to facilitate the optimal social inclusion of people in recovery from mental illness (""in recovery"") [1]. The first human library was set up in 2000 in Denmark with the theme ""Stop the Violence,"" and the approach has continuously evolved since [2]. According to Johannsen, the human library is ""an innovative method designed to promote dialogue, reduce prejudices, and encourage understanding"" [1]. By participating in the human library, readers (visitors) can engage in a dialogue with ""living books,"" or storytellers, whom they may seldom meet in daily life [3]. Following this rationale, the human library approach has been promoted in other countries and adopted in various fields [3,4].
The human library has pragmatic relevance to the field of mental health services. People in recovery encounter difficulties not only due to their symptoms but also from other people's stereotypes and prejudices about mental illness [5,6]. Stigma and misunderstanding of mental illness remain serious issues [7][8][9][10], as they are often considered barriers to social inclusion [11,12]. Stigma may even discourage people in recovery from seeking professional support [13]. A lack of personal contact between people in recovery and the public is one of the reasons for stigma towards people with mental health issues [14], and, therefore, facilitating intergroup contact between people in recovery and other community members may be helpful. This idea is consistent with the intergroup contact hypothesis formalized by Allport [15], who suggested that positive contact between groups can reduce negative prejudice. Moreover, recent studies have shown that face-to-face contact can be effective in reducing mental health stigma [16]. As the human library approach focuses on facilitating intergroup contact [17], it seems to be a promising intervention method of tackling the stigma of mental health. Given that impersonal large-scale mental health care promotions targeting the stigma of mental illness may not be very effective [18], exploring the application of the human library as an alternative approach may be valuable.
In human library practice, the word ""dialogue"" is often emphasized because of the rationale that personal contact is powerful and can challenge negative stereotypes [19]. The dialogic nature of a human library distinguishes it from large-scale one-way mental health talks delivered mainly by mental health professionals. In this dialogic environment, living books have control of the conversation according to the reader's interest [20]. Unlike health care talks, in which the content is usually prepared, the human library allows spontaneous interactions between living books and readers [21]. As such interactive engagement is considered an important element of contact-based mental health intervention [22], it is important to understand whether and how this relationship can be maintained when the human library approach is used to promote greater social equity for people in recovery.
The human library approach has the potential to significantly improve social inclusion. The facilitation of book-reader dialogue may reduce the social distance between people in recovery and people without mental health issues. As reported by Frey and Powell [23], human libraries can help improve social relationships. In their study, the participants gained insights into community relationships, such as, ""[p]eople are friendly if you open up"" and ""I really liked the chance to get to know a member of the Center community a little better"" (pp. 74-75). By adopting the human library in a mental health setting, the ""us-them"" demarcation between people in recovery and other community members may be reduced.
The human library approach has other potential benefits for both readers and living books. Visitors (readers) to a human library may gain first-hand knowledge by meeting people who have experienced mental health issues (living books). As Schur and her colleagues [24] found, prior contact with people with disabilities can reduce negative stereotypes. An evaluation study of a contact-based anti-stigma intervention program in Canada [25] showed that personal contact with people who have experienced mental health difficulties can help challenge stereotypes in a school setting. Another study conducted in Canada suggested that contact-based strategies work for reducing mental illness-related stigma in pharmacy students [26].
Storytelling can be an enabling process for the living books. The human library approach helps living books (who are usually socio-economically disadvantaged group members) to connect with readers (other community members) [27]. According to Dobreski and Huang [27], by participating in dialogue, living books have opportunities to reflect on and review their past experiences. Hence, dialogue can be a learning experience for living books as well as readers [28].
Although intergroup contact has benefits, the quality of the interaction matters. Merely bringing two groups together is not enough to overcome stigma and avoid misunderstandings. Without careful planning and arrangement, intergroup contact can ""serve to confirm rather than undermine negative attitudes towards outgroups"" (p. 201) [29]. To avoid such negative consequences when implementing the human library approach in a mental health setting, a closer look at the approach is vital.
Although the human library approach is becoming popular globally, it has received little exploration in scholarly literature [3,19,26,30]. Although this approach may potentially improve social inclusion, its implementation to reduce the stigma of mental illness is still in the beginning stages. It remains to be seen how human libraries may contribute to the promotion of mental health care.
Guided by the general aim of the human library approach, a mental health organization in Hong Kong conducted a 1-year trial run of this intervention practice. The author was invited by this organization to conduct a program evaluation of this practice. Initially, the organization was eager to prove the effectiveness of this approach in facilitating social inclusion. However, because the project was still in its beginning stages, it was necessary to start with a deep qualitative inquiry into the approach before conducting large-scale quantitative program evaluation. Against this backdrop, the first-year experience of practice of the human library was used as the case in the current study. As the application of the human library in mental health care is still not very common and such practice experience has not been well documented in the literature, particular attention was given to understanding practitioners' experience in adopting this intervention practice in a mental health service context.
Materials and Methods
My aim was to discover relevant knowledge about the human library approach by reviewing and reflecting on practitioners' experiences [31]. A practitioner inquiry group was formed because this research method helps practitioners to review their practice [32]. Practitioner inquiry is regarded as a work-based learning process that can generate contextualized knowledge [33]. The inquiry process itself is empowering, as practitioners can discover knowledge by themselves and for themselves [34]. Although the knowledge generated might have limited generalizability, it can lay the foundation for large-scale quantitative studies in the future.
Ethical approval was obtained from the author's affiliated university (No. 2-19-201911-01). Two sessions of practitioner inquiry group discussion were held at the meeting room of the service center, a place with which the inquiry group members were familiar. The inquiry group members were invited by the organization. There were seven participants: four social workers and three peer support workers. The inclusion criteria were having served the organization as paid staff and having participated in organizing and offering the human library for at least 6 months. To ensure the reliability of the findings [35], two types of practitioners were included. The four social workers had participated in the human library as librarians, and the three peer support workers, who experienced mental health problems (schizophrenia and depression), had participated as living books. The mean age of the inquiry group members was 40, and their average length of experience in mental health service was 8.3 years.
Informed consent was obtained from the inquiry group members, who were regarded as equal partners rather than passive research subjects. The author, who had several years of experience of working with people in recovery but was not involved in the implementation of the human library, served as the moderator of the inquiry group. An initial discussion was conducted with one of the team members (also a group member) to determine the inquiry group's arrangement, following the recommendations of Reason [36]. As the teammates were not familiar with the practitioner inquiry method, basic information about this method was provided to them.
At the beginning of the first session, the inquiry group members discussed the purposes of the group. The agreed-upon goal was to identify the nature and possible usefulness of the human library in promoting mental health. The group hoped to produce a manual for the human library approach that listed its basic principles and procedures to support and improve future practice. The moderator followed a predetermined topic guide to invite group members to critically discuss the nature of the human library and the ways it could be useful based on their experience of running it. Open-ended questions were developed by the author according to the objectives of the study. Sample questions included ""What can the human library achieve?"" and ""What do you think about the usefulness of human library practice?"" Points of difference were celebrated, as one aim was to avoid possible problems caused by ""group think"" [37]. Opportunities were given for the group members to discuss anything they regarded as relevant. The first session lasted for approximately 90 min. The discussions were digitally recorded, and a verbatim transcription of each recording was produced.
Thematic analysis was used [38] to analyze the data. Initial codes were generated after repeated independent readings of the transcripts by the author and a research assistant. Analysis was undertaken by collating all of the codes. Possible themes related to the research objective were also identified.
Themes across the seven participants thus emerged, and these themes were reviewed and re-named for meaning before the final article was produced. Negative case analysis [39] was conducted and possible drawbacks of this approach were identified. To enhance the validity of the data, a member check group session was conducted, lasting for approximately 1 h. The author reported the initial findings (i.e., the five major themes) to the whole inquiry group. All of the members agreed on the themes, although some of them offered remarks on the operational details (e.g., the length of each session, the total number of living books available each time). Although these suggestions were not included in this article, they were useful for the production of the manual of human library practice. In the writing process, a representative of the inquiry group was involved as an advisor and provided comments and suggestions. We discussed the data and our ideas before preparing this article.
Results
On the whole, the participants held favorable attitudes toward the human library approach, which they considered to be well suited to the mental health service context. The human library approach was perceived to be effective in achieving the service organizer's initial objective of facilitating social inclusion. The participants identified benefits of being living books that may positively influence people's recovery from mental illness, and possible negative effects on living books were also noted. Five interrelated main themes were identified:
1.
The dialogic nature of the human library generates positive effects.
2.
The human library can reduce prejudice against people in recovery.
3.
The human library can help remove the barriers between people in recovery and other community members. 4.
As living books, people in recovery can obtain insights and emotional support from readers.
5.
People in recovery may get hurt in the interaction process.
The Dialogic Nature of the Human Library Generates Positive Effects
Unsurprisingly, the participants highlighted the dialogic nature of the approach. However, they emphasized that the human library approach is much more effective than large-scale one-way intervention approaches. The group members mostly compared the human library approach with conventional educational activities.
""A group format in the human library allows more in-depth [interaction], achieving an effect that cannot be achieved by a conventional health talk. Talks can accommodate a large audience, but the content tends to be general, and it cannot allow the direct, in-depth contacts that the human library can achieve."" (David, male, social worker)
The participants considered the dialogic nature of the human library to be essential to facilitating better interaction, making room for creativity:
""The human library focuses on interaction, and there are few restrictions on the dialogue, allowing more creativity."" (Billy, male, peer support worker)
The group members also stressed that having direct encounters between people in recovery and other community members was important. They suggested that the human library allows people in recovery to represent themselves without an intermediary: ""The human library indeed gives community members one more channel to understand another side of our people in recovery, who often rely on newspapers and whispered rumor. They might not have a chance to engage in an equal dialogue in a safe environment."" (Peter, male, social worker)
The group members compared the human library with the conventional mental health promotion approach driven by mental health professionals: ""For the usual practice of community education, the voices and experiences of people in recovery may not be reflected. But I believe that [people in recovery] participate more [in the human library]."" (May, female, peer support worker)
The peer support workers pointed out that the human library is conducted flexibly on an ad hoc basis. Living books can adapt and tailor the sharing content to readers immediately rather than describing a complete narrative: ""In a talk, listeners listen passively. As speakers, we are asked to tell our whole story. But in the human library, it does not matter whether the sharing is complete or not. The important thing is to let readers know what they want to know."" (Billy, male, peer support worker)
Another group member stated that the content that people in recovery prepare for sharing is relatively unimportant: ""The thing that matters most for the human library is people's interaction."" (David, male, social worker)
The Human Library Can Reduce Prejudice against People in Recovery
All of the group members agreed that the human library can reduce readers' discrimination against people in recovery, thereby promoting diversity. When asked what the human library can achieve, a peer support worker reported the following:
""We can indeed live very well in the community, inclusively. By showing that, pointless discrimination can hopefully be reduced."" (Billy, male, peer support worker) Group members stressed that the benefits to readers went beyond an intellectual understanding of people in recovery: ""[The human library] allows a higher level of involvement of people in recovery in the community . . . that can help eliminate people's stereotypes. This can also be achieved, not because of telling people this and that about mental health; the important point here is the inclusion.""(May, female, peer support worker)
The first-hand sharing by people in recovery is good evidence that they are part of the community. Some members believed that the human library can reduce intergroup prejudice by publicly portraying accurate and positive images of people in recovery: ""[Readers] gain more understanding of the living books, people in recovery, which is in-depth. They can identify a lot of strengths that people in recovery possess."" (Peter, male, social worker)
Peter further explained the importance of face-to-face personal contact in the human library. He said the human library: ""allows people to understand what people in recovery feel and experience, so that [their] acceptance will be enhanced."" (Peter, male, social worker)
The Human Library Approach Can Help Remove the Barriers between People in Recovery and Other Community Members
In addition to the benefits that readers and living books obtain, the group members believed that interaction in the human library may help address the problem of ""othering,"" breaking down the us-them demarcation between people in recovery and other community members. When asked about the benefits of the human library approach, nearly all of the group members said that it promotes social inclusion:
""It facilitates better mutual understanding [between readers and living books]."" (May, female, peer support worker)
May, who had served as a living book, further explained this benefit: ""I think by running the human library, we can gain a better understanding of each other. They [readers] know more about us [people in recovery]. We can know the opposite side's perspective, knowing how others perceive people in recovery. Both sides can exchange ideas."" (May, female, peer support worker)
Another group member, a social worker, agreed that the human library can facilitate social inclusion. She suggested that positive changes can occur on both sides: ""I believe [the human library] can facilitate social inclusion, considering that they [people in recovery] are part of society. Furthermore, this is consistent with the recovery model, facilitating a win-win situation [for people in recovery and other community members]."" (Joe, female, social worker)
As Living Books, People in Recovery Can Obtain Insights and Emotional Support from Readers
Interaction between living books and readers is not a one-way street. Readers can raise issues for living books to think about, and by doing so can promote living books' personal growth: ""I mentioned a quarrel I had with my [former] boss, in which I almost got into a fight with him. A reader asked me a question: ""Has your boss forgiven you?"" This question gave me the opportunity to reflect on whether my boss had forgiven me. That was important; how could I ignore it? I realized that I had made my apology, and he had accepted it."" (John, male, peer support worker)
In addition, the peer support workers reported that they experienced validation in the process: ""I recalled that in a dialogue with university students, one of them was also a mother. When she responded to my sharing, my experience was validated because she told me she had a similar experience. By having such a dialogue, I felt that I got a kind of support."" (May, female, peer support worker)
A social worker also recalled the interaction in the human library that offered emotional support for the living books: ""A living book was so excited to tell his story, and [he] became hyper. But then he suddenly became emotional. Perhaps, when he narrated his story, he felt he was so pitiful: no child, no family, lonely and going to die alone. A man in front of him was in tears, and gave a response. The response allowed the living book to realize that someone supported him, and [he was] not alone. This reset his emotions, and he started to become happy again. Simply put, the feedback was so nice."" (Ann, female, social worker)
People in Recovery May Get Hurt in the Interaction Process
In addition to the positive aspects of the human library, group members were asked to describe any possible negative effects it might have in a mental health setting. A common concern raised by the group members was that the interaction may be risky for people in recovery:
""A person who narrates his/her experience may get hurt if there is no response at all. Merely talking [to readers] is just like [playing] a voice recorder, which can make [living books] feel bad."" (David, male, social worker) Worse still, the responses that readers give may make living books feel emotionally vulnerable. All three peer support workers suggested that living books need to be aware of their own emotions in the process: ""As a living book, there is a need to be emotionally self-sensitive. When we find that we almost collapse, that we may get hurt, then we need to remind ourselves to shift topics. Because the living book has the right not to answer any questions if we do not want to . . . Perhaps the challenge of the human library, for me, is that you cannot expect what readers want to ask. For example, some questions they ask may be challenging and may trigger our negative emotions."" (Billy, male, peer support worker)
Billy suggested that living books should receive training to make sure that they are psychologically strong enough.
Discussion
To the best of the author's knowledge, this study is the first to examine the usefulness of the human library approach in a Chinese mental health setting. This approach originated as an anti-violence project, and it has since been adopted to promote the experiences of various disadvantaged groups [1]. The present study indicates that the human library approach has value and potential in mental health settings, as it can effectively facilitate social inclusion and promote recovery.
According to the seven participants in the inquiry group, the human library approach has obvious benefits in challenging stereotypes about people in recovery. Although large-scale mental health promotion is still common, it may not always be very successful [18]. Some people may be skeptical of the positive descriptions of individuals in recovery provided by government entities or health care professionals. As an alternative approach, a human library may be much more convincing, as it gives participants real and direct encounters with people in recovery. Hence, further application of the human library approach to reduce mental health-related stigma should be considered. By introducing a human library to a mental health setting, people in recovery and other community members can develop meaningful relationships, fostering social inclusion. Based on the results reported in this study, participants in a human library can experience meaningful social inclusion. Indeed, the equal-status interactions between living books and readers breaks down the us-them demarcation between people in recovery and other community members. Ideally, by having more dialogue in the community, the line between the two groups can be further blurred and all members can live equally.
Unlike traditional methods of promoting mental health care, the human library approach gives people in recovery opportunities to exchange ideas and develop relationships with other community members in a spontaneous, informal manner. Often, people in recovery are told what is happening to them. The human library can provide a platform for such people to narrate their experiences. Rather than being represented by health care professionals or someone else, people in recovery can speak for themselves in a human library. In this way, they regain the power to interpret their experiences. These features are the essence of what distinguishes the human library approach from large-scale mental health promotion approaches, which are often driven by professionals.
By telling their stories, people in recovery may reconstruct their experiences. The feedback that readers give may also offer insights and comfort, which are valuable for someone in recovery. Simply put, the dialogic process can generate therapeutic effects for people in recovery. According to those who participated in the inquiry group, the human library approach also seems to echo recovery-oriented practice. Rather than focusing on symptoms or treatment, the human library approach demonstrates resilience through the stories of people in recovery [40]. Living books show readers that despite encountering mental health problems, they can still live with their own personal challenges and take part meaningfully in the community. In addition, this approach appears to be a good strategy for facilitating an environment in which people in recovery can regain power. By having a platform to speak for themselves, they may be able to challenge the dominant narrative about their place in society [41]. However, relatively little scholarly attention has been given to this issue faced by individuals in recovery [27]. To better manage the experiences that people in recovery have as living books in the human library, further investigation and discussion are necessary.
The results of the current study have several implications for mental health promotion policy and practice. To begin with, mental health professionals should consider the human library as one of their approaches. It is worth noting that the success of the human library seems to rest on its dialogic nature. Mental health service managers may be inclined to deviate from it to offer interventions at a lower unit cost. However, when many people attend a human library session, interactive dialogue may not be possible, and the positive impact may be greatly reduced. Considering that many people in recovery tend to be vulnerable [42], there should be safeguards to protect them when they narrate their personal stories. The role of the librarian (the person who facilitates the dialogue) is necessary to ensure that the dialogue takes place in a respectful manner, as the ""do no harm"" principle [43] should always be upheld. Arrangements such as selection, pre-sharing training, and debriefing of living books are all very important. These points will be included in a practice manual published by the inquiry group.
As noted above, the human library approach has an advantage over large-scale, impersonal mental health wellness methods. Although it was not directly proposed by the inquiry members here, policy makers should consider allocating resources for impactful promotion strategies. Although further empirical evidence may be required to demonstrate the effectiveness of the human library practice in promoting mental health, it seems to be a promising approach that deserves further attention.
There are several limitations to the present study. It was based on the perspective of a group of practitioners from only one mental health organization in Hong Kong. As the number of inquiry group members was small, the themes identified in the study should be regarded as hypotheses that require further examination with larger samples. As the inquiry group examined the practice over the course of the last year, selective memory bias might have occurred. Although the author directed the inquiry group members to focus on work-based learning rather than on proving the effectiveness of their interventions, the effect of social desirability may still have influenced the study's results. Likewise, although reflexivity was stressed throughout the research process, the author's own bias may still have informed the way in which conclusions were drawn. The engagement of the inquiry group members provided valuable feedback against which the author can compare his assumptions. In addition, as only practitioners' views were considered in the current study, there is a need to quantitatively and qualitatively explore the perspectives and experiences of readers attending the human library. Particular attention should be paid to the extent to which the human library can facilitate social inclusion among people with mental health issues. Finally, a follow-up qualitative study is needed to investigate the effects of individuals' experience as living books on their recovery.
Conclusions
Community-based approaches to mental health care may reduce the social exclusion of people in recovery. However, efforts are required to create a harmonious social environment for both people in recovery and other community members [13]. While interventions can be conducted at various levels, from micro to macro, the human library approach seems to be a promising way of facilitating social inclusion and promoting recovery, which supports the view that the further development of this approach in a mental health setting would be advantageous to people in recovery. Stereotypes about people in recovery exist because many people do not have the opportunity to engage in in-depth dialogue with them. The practitioner inquiry group in this study revealed that a human library can serve as an effective intervention to clarify misunderstandings and facilitate social inclusion. The wall between people in recovery and other community members can thus be broken down. People in recovery may also benefit from serving as living books. Engaging in dialogue with other community members may be simple, but such opportunities are valuable for those in recovery. A dialogue on equal footing can allow them to obtain insights and gain emotional support, which are beneficial for their mental health recovery.",5414,5881
10.29173/iasl7197,,Brown 2016 ,True,Deborah Brown,School libraries as power-houses of empathy: People for loan in The Human Library,"
The capacity of literary fiction to foster the trait of empathy in readers has received significant recent coverage in popular and academic literature (see for example, Gavigan & Kurtts 2011). School libraries, through their natural connection to storytelling in all its forms, can help foster a culture of empathy and respect, and can play an active role in promoting tolerance within the school community. This paper will focus on the worldwide movement known as The Human Library, which aims to ""challenge prejudice through conversation"" (Human Library UK 2016a). The Human Library reimagines the concept of a reader opening a book and looking at life through the eyes of 'the other' as they turn the pages, by replacing physical books with 'living books': people from all walks of life who volunteer to be 'borrowed' by a 'reader' for a conversation.Through respectful dialogue, stereotypes can be broken down and empathy can replace stigmatization. This paper will focus on how any school can host a Human Library to build a culture that celebrates, rather than fears, diversity and difference.
",2010,Library Student Journal,,"Introduction
What is empathy? In its simplest form, empathy is the ability to imagine what another person might be thinking or feeling. It is often described as the ability to walk a mile in someone else's shoes. In the literary world, Atticus Finch, in To Kill a Mockingbird, said that ""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view until you climb into his skin and walk around in it"" (Lee 2010, p. 33). This is the embodiment of empathy as it generally understood: the ability to see the world through the eyes of another. But empathy also operates on a deeper cognitive level when it enables us to understand why someone might decide something or act in a certain way irrespective of whether we agree with what they have done or not (Stripling 2012, p. 20).
The school library has many roles and functions in the 21 st century. We know that we haven't been simple book repositories for decades. Our continuous existence in the digital age has been a result of the way we respond to a changing world and to the changing needs of our clients. We are makerspaces, media hubs and digital production studios. We are literacy and research centres. But we are so much more than this too. Libraries are places that nurture values and ethics. We promote academic honesty and stewardship of resources. We facilitate knowledge of 'the other' through curating collections of fiction and non-fiction that reflect the diversity of the world. Foust and Ahkmed argue that libraries by the very nature of those who look after them, espouse values ""such as freedom of speech and a love of knowledge"" that nurture and promote empathy (2014, p. 92). This paper will examine the role of the school library in supporting diversity in the school community; how the school library can play a key role in fostering a culture of empathy and respect amongst students in the school community and, more broadly, between our students and the broader community beyond our school's walls.
Specifically, this paper will discuss how adding human books to your library collection can make your library a power-house of empathy building in your school: how your library can potentially change lives not just through literacy and learning, but through actively facilitating connections and conversations between your students and people they may never have an opportunity to come into contact with in their everyday lives. This is the ethos behind the Human Library: that stereotypes can be shattered, that prejudice can be stripped away and replaced with empathy, through the mechanism of conversation and dialogue.
Fiction fosters empathy
As librarians, we know the power of a story to transport and transform. As a child I longed to find a wardrobe that I could step into, gently part the hanging fur coats to find a glowing lamppost and a snow covered Narnia-like world. Unfortunately I never literally managed to find that world, but I'm sure we all know the thrill of travelling to other places, other times, through war zones and fantasy worlds through the books we have immersed ourselves in. And we know the thrill of seeing our students view the world through the eyes of someone they are not: a different gender, a different age, a different colour or nationality, a different life. The author of Game of Thrones, George R. R. Martin has been quoted as saying that ""a reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one.""
Reading fiction, literary fiction, breeds empathy. What is it like to live in a slum in Calcutta? To have a disfigured face? To be forced into marriage at age ten? For a girl to have to dress as a boy in order to feed one's family? To have a close family member die of cancer? While many of our day-to-day experiences can be influenced by stereotypes and assumptions and by the superficial labels that we use to categorise those we think we have the measure of, the lives of those we meet in literary fiction may ""disrupt our expectations"", leading us to a greater understanding of others (Comer Kidd & Castano 2013, p. 378). Author Neil Gaiman says that when you read fiction ""you're being someone else, and when you return to your own world, you're going to be slightly changed (Gaiman 2013). A number of recent studies have concluded that reading literary fiction fosters the trait of empathy: how we relate to others and recognise the inherent humanity in others, especially in those who may appear to be different to ourselves (see for example, Chiaet 2013; Bergland 2014). There is power in fiction, power in storytelling, to illuminate the unknown, the out of reach, the 'other'.
Globalization, social media and the information explosion have apparently brought the world to our laptops. Or have they? We want our students to be citizens of the world, but we are mindful that in contrast to the perspective that the internet opens our students' eyes to the world's diversity, it is also possible for any person to have their world view narrowed by being exposed to an endless stream of information and invective that simply reinforces strongly held pre-existing beliefs. No matter how obscure or simply incorrect my views might be about a particular group in society or a significant global issue, I will be able to find someone or some organisation online that supports what I think, tells me I am right and reinforces my solipsistic and possibly deeply misguided views. This is why empathy is often touted as the most important 21 st century skill: in order to be a truly global community, in order for our students to be effective global leaders and advocates for the rights of all people, they must first be able to identify with the vast diversity of humanity.
Human Libraries
Which brings me to the Human Library. In the Human Library, instead of borrowing a printed book and experiencing another life through the words on the page, patrons borrow a living book, sit down for a short conversation with them, and see the world through the eyes of someone very different to themselves; someone who they may have preconceived ideas about; someone who they may assume they know; someone who they may stereotype without even being aware of it.
The first Human Library was held at the Roskilde music festival in Denmark in 2000. Now Human Library events are held in more than 70 countries worldwide (Human Library UK, 2016b).
Its roots date back to 1993, when five teenagers, motivated by the violent stabbing of a friend in Copenhagen, created a youth organisation called Stop the Violence. Stop the Violence aimed to reduce youth violence and to counteract the negative stereotyping of Danish youth that had emerged in the media reports of the attack on their friend (Human Library UK, 2016b).
By the year 2000, when Stop the Violence had more than 30,000 members, they were approached by the Roskilde Festival organizers to create an activity that would build positive connections and dialogue between the many different subcultures, some hostile to each other, attending the festival (Human Library UK, 2016b). Roskilde is a massive music festival that attracts music fans from throughout Europe and around the world. That year more than 100,000 people attended the festival. The event that was created was the first Human Library, and it featured over 75 human books (Human Library UK, 2016b).
Since then the movement has grown worldwide. It has been held in Festivals in Ireland and Russia, Universities in Manila, Las Vegas and Poland, Museums in Chicago, Colleges in Kazakhstan and public libraries in Copenhagen (Human Library, 2016b). I'll now digress for a moment to tell you a little about myself and the school in which I work. I manage the library in a secondary school just on the northern side of Sydney Harbour, Australia. Monte is an independent, Catholic girls' high school, with almost 1200 students. We offer the International Baccalaureate curriculum to our students from years 7 to 12. Monte is a metropolitan school, located in an affluent business district. The values of our school are deeply rooted in social justice, advocacy and recognition of the human dignity inherent in all people. 7% of our students come from a non-English language background (Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, 2016). In Sydney, that's a very low percentage, when almost 38% of people in Sydney speak a language other than English at home (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2012). Eight years ago our wonderful teacher librarian, Jenny Uther, was looking for a way to facilitate an authentic empathy-building experience for our students: to get them to engage with the world by bringing the world into our school -actually into our school library. She implemented our annual Human Library event, and it is now one of the biggest events on our school library's calendar, with up to twelve living books involved, and more than 120 students borrowing from this precious temporary collection.
Methodology
So how does it work? The Human Library organisation has established a methodology outlining the best way to run the event. The methodology is based on two principles: inclusion and choice (Human Library UK, 2016c).
Inclusion is enacted in the way that the living books are recruited from all walks of life, from a broad range of backgrounds and experiences. The Human Library is not intended to be used to highlight a single issue or a particular group. By being inclusive, it sends a powerful message that discrimination and stereotyping can be experienced by many different, perhaps unexpected groups in our communities (Human Library UK, 2016c).
The second part of the methodology is about choice, and there are a number of different aspects to this. Patrons of the Human Library, in our case our students, must be given choice over whether or not to participate, over which living book to borrow; choice over the questions they will ask and the conversation they will have with the book they borrow. This is a key tenet of the event and it embodies the idea that while we are trying to break down preconceived assumptions about different people in society, we are extending that to our patrons -making no assumptions about them, why they may choose to participate or not, or why they are choosing to borrow a particular book.
In addition, the books have choices: they choose whether or not to participate, whether to answer a particular question from the borrower, and whether to themselves ask a question of the patron who has borrowed them (Human Library UK, 2016c).
Planning and implementation
Organizing a Human Library event in a school does take a significant amount of planning and time. I must emphasise that I am lucky to have a library team that is fully committed to organizing and implementing this event.
Planning begins with setting a date for the event, and navigating the many different school calendars in which other faculties have booked events or exams. Finding a date that will not be overly disruptive to our school is key, as we are taking students out of classes and monopolising our library spaces during the event. We run the event for about two hours on the designated day.
One of the key elements of a successful Human Library event is to compile an eclectic collection of living books. This is perhaps the most challenging part of hosting the Human Library in your school. We spend a month or two recruiting our books. We advertise in the school newsletter that goes to parents each week, explaining the concept and asking for people in the extended school community to consider volunteering. We email the staff at the school, asking if they might know someone who would be suitable. We contact organisations that represent groups who might have experienced stigmatization or feel side-lined from mainstream society. We also draw on the immediate school community, because we know that there are some amazing people who we cross paths with everyday who are experiencing or have experienced discrimination, or misunderstanding. We are looking for diversity within our collection, and variety from year to year so that we address the many different kinds of prejudices or stigmas that our students may knowingly or unknowingly have. Some examples of the books we have recruited for our Human Library events include:
•
Katie is a Year 9 student at our school. She was born with a profound hearing disability, and received a cochlear implant to enable her to hear when she was just a little girl. A cochlear implant is an electronic device that replaces the function of the damaged part of the inner ear. It's clear from her implant that she has a hearing difficulty and she has been so generous and brave to volunteer her time as a living book in our Human Library twice now, so that other students can find out what it's like to be at school everyday hearing the world differently.
•
Rolf has been one of our living books for three years. He lost most of his vision due to the eye condition macular degeneration. With the aid of technology and his beautiful guide dog, Echo, he has adapted to his vision loss.
•
Cody is an incredibly charismatic man with professional qualifications in management and human resources. He also lives with the chronic condition cystic fibrosis.
•
Sister Jackie is a retired nun, a Sister of Mercy, who spent more than ten years living and working in the shanty towns of Cerro Choclo and Cerro Candela near Lima, Peru to improve the lives of women and children.
•
Jo has overcome the eating disorder anorexia nervosa • Taghred is a mother of four who came to Australia from Lebanon as a small child. She is a Muslim, lives in Sydney and wears here headscarf to work everyday.
•
Theresa is an Indigenous Australian woman who grew up among the Worimi people in an aboriginal mission on the North Coast of New South Wales.
•
Stephen was diagnosed with the chronic illness multiple sclerosis 15 years ago and now works for the MS Society managing their ambassador program.
•
Samantha is a scientist working at the Centre for Hypersonics at the University of Queensland. Her area of speciality is supersonic combustion research, and everyday she challenges stereotypical thinking about women in the world of science.
•
Natalie is another of our local heroes, a staff member at our school library, who was born in South Africa and grew up under the Apartheid system of racial segregation. She has first-hand experience of brutal discrimination based simply on the colour of her skin.
•
Ella is a young woman who experienced homelessness at the age of 14.
Common to each of our books is the fact that they have experienced being stereotyped or subject to discrimination at some point in their lives.
As the date of the event draws closer, we start our publicity campaign: promoting and explaining the event to our student body in order to encourage them to participate. We produce a digital slideshow, a 'catalogue' of the books, with a short explanation or 'blurb' about each book, which is shown to students in library classes and English classes. We advertise the event in the daily student newsletter and we ensure that all our teachers know about the event and so can encourage their students to attend. We then request that students who would like to borrow a human book nominate the book they would like to borrow, their preferred time, and register for the event either online using a digital form linked from our library website, or using a printed form which we make available at our library loans desk.
Student volunteers from senior years are also recruited to assist us with marshalling and timekeeping on the day. They escort our borrowers to their book, introduce them and discreetly ensure that loans are kept to the 15 minutes allocated time.
We have on average 120 students participating in the Human Library as book borrowers each year. This makes it the largest event of the year on our library calendar. We are keenly aware that some students, particular the younger students, may be nervous or shy about holding a conversation with a person that they do not know, so we allow our students to attend in pairs, or groups up to a maximum of three students.
Dreher and Mowbray write that the safe, comfortable environment of a Human Library event is thought to contribute to a ""non-judgemental atmosphere"" conducive to open conversations (2012, p. 25). We set our library up on the day somewhat like a café: a table for each book with chairs arranged around it; a printed name label for each of our books and even flowers on the tables. We are trying to cultivate an intimate, personal, somewhat informal environment that feels relaxed but still respectful.
The beauty of the interaction is in its simplicity: having a conversation is something we all, irrespective of our different backgrounds, are familiar with. It is a dialogue between two people, the borrower and the book, who are demonstrating by their very presence that they are open to having their thinking challenged, to sharing something of themselves. Importantly, as Ashmore points out, the interaction between 'reader' and 'book' in the Human Library is a reciprocal transaction in which both participants are sharing and exchanging information (2010, p. 3). In this way the Human Library transcends the metaphor of having 'books' and 'readers', which perhaps falsely implies a one-sided scenario in which a storyteller downloads content to a passive recipient. It is, instead, a genuinely bilateral interaction where participants meet as equals.
Support from senior management
Within your school, and in your communication with the key decision makers at your school, there are clear benefits in making explicit the link between the Human Library and the broader strategic goals of your school. By drawing connections between your goals for the event and the values underpinning your school, you are demonstrating to key decision makers that your library plays a pivotal role in maintaining and developing the principles for which your school stands. For example, my school has a strategic vision document which outlines six key goals, the first of which concerns continuation of the traditions and values of the school, anchored in a concern for social justice and human dignity. Another goal is to be a leader in 21 st Century learning by providing innovative, authentic learning experiences to our students (Monte Sant' Angelo Mercy College, 2012).
In the annual report on library operations that I prepare for senior management each year, I make an explicit connection between the outcomes of the activities we hold and the longterm goals of our school. The Human Library clearly provides an opportunity for our students to engage in immersive, authentic, experiential learning, compatible with the values and ethos of the school. Holding the event creates a strong anchor for us to publicise how the library's role and influence is not limited merely to what goes on within our walls, and is certainly not limited to what you see on our shelves. The broader implication of holding events such as this is that school libraries can have profound, life-long impacts on students beyond providing literacy instruction or technical skills.
Link to International Baccalaureate values
As an International Baccalaureate (IB) school that offers both the Middle Years Program and the Diploma Program, we have taken to heart the IB's mission statement to ""help create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect"" (International Baccalaureate Organisation, 2016). From the time our students enter our school they are encouraged to recognise the common humanity of all people, and to develop the ten attributes known as the IB Learner Profile. In order to be responsible members of their local and global communities students are encouraged to be inquirers, knowledgeable, thinkers, communicators, principled, open-minded, caring, risk-takers, balanced and reflective (International Baccalaureate Organization, 2013). Opportunities to actively nurture and develop these attributes are highly valued by our school, and it is self-evident that students who engage with the Human Library experience are called on to demonstrate many if not all of the learner profile traits. This contributes not only to student development within the IB framework, but provides another compelling reason for the school to support the event year after year.
Evaluation & feedback
One of the key elements that we have incorporated into our iteration of the Human Library is a feedback component. Most importantly, we want to get evidence that our goal, which is to foster empathy and challenge stereotyping, is being achieved. What are the students getting out of the experience? Was it what they expected? Would they attend again, or encourage others to attend? Did it change their thinking in any way? The other reason we gather feedback is a little more pragmatic: we want to publicise the work of the library, our initiatives, our achievements, and if we can do this using the voices of the students who benefit from our programs, it adds authenticity to the story that we are telling about our library in our newsletters to parents, in our library annual report, and in our school yearbook.
We have used several different mechanisms to gather student feedback on their experience of the Human Library. In previous years we have invited students to fill out an online form containing some question prompts. More recently however we have been using a class set of iPads connected to our interactive whiteboard, with the Padlet app to create a digital canvas of student comments that are visible to all participants, both the borrowers and the books.
Examples of student feedback include:
Sarah was very brave to share her stories and teach us that to overcome something in life takes courage and persistence but will have a positive impact on our lives and future Today I have really enjoyed being involved in the Human Library. Talking to Rolf was an experience I will never forget. I learnt new things and think that we shouldn't take things for granted because we are not experiencing things in comparison to others. Rolf was very inspiring and I know others will feel the same Talking to Teresa was really interesting and engaging. Hearing her story was a great experience. It was amazing to hear how different her life as a child was to how her life is now and also how our life is.
Affirmation of books
A fascinating tangential benefit of holding a Human Library event is that the act of taking part in it as a human book is an affirming experience for participants, and can even be a confidence-building experience for them (Dreher & Mowbray 2012, p. 45). Our living books have expressed to us how being involved makes them feel valued, how they appreciate the opportunity to tell their stories to a willing audience, how they feel they are making an active contribution towards the promotion of tolerance and diversity.
We welcome feedback from our living books, which they can also record on our Padlet wall:
Your questions and interactions were thoughtful, considerate and very enjoyable to engage with. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with you today and hope to see you again next year.
In addition, our living books enjoy the opportunity to interact with each other. We schedule the event with a break in the middle, coinciding with the students' 'recess' (morning tea) break. This gives our guests an opportunity to meet each other informally over coffee, to share stories, discuss the event and simply to chat. In one way it could be said that this is their opportunity to 'borrow' each other.
Conclusion
Sometimes it is the simplest thing that can profoundly impact on a life. The Human Library leverages the simple act of a conversation to find common ground and understanding between 'book' and 'reader'. Facilitating a respectful conversation between willing participants has the potential to imbue sometimes divisive issues like race, religion or disability with humanity and dignity. Scaffolding the event using metaphors ('book', 'reader') familiar to students that invoke the welcoming intimacy of a library contributes to the culture of openness, honesty and respect that are essential to holding a successful Human Library event.
By openly celebrating and affirming the diversity of the living books who generously consent to being borrowed as part of the Human Library, we are sending a powerful message to the school community that we value and affirm our students' differences as well. Providing access to a library of living books creates a forum to highlight the sometimes insidious nature of discrimination and exclusion, and creates a culture of celebrating, rather than fearing, diversity.

Human libraries are events intended to provide readers with access to the knowledge and lived experiences of their fellow community members. These events are growing in popularity worldwide, and while often hosted by traditional libraries, can take place in a variety of community organization settings. Human library events depend on the services of the ""human books"" who volunteer to participate, though recruitment of these volunteers remains one of the most challenging aspects of hosting the events. Previous work has shown that human books enjoy participation in these events, though the specific benefits of human libraries for the human books have not been explored. In this study, we analyze the post-event survey responses of human books from four different human library events hosted by various institutions. Participants reported a variety of benefits ranging from altruistic to more self-focused. Reviewing their responses, we suggest eight major categories of benefits for human books. Findings hold implications for effectively recruiting and motivating potential human books, as well as how host institutions may adapt human libraries to the needs of their communities.
",2016-01,Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology,Wiley,"INTRODUCTION
Human libraries are events designed to engage community members in breaking down barriers and learning from each other's experiences. Originating as social activist events in Europe (Watkins, 2014), human libraries events have spread worldwide and occurred in over 70 countries (""The Human Library Organization,"" n.d.). These events utilize the metaphor of a library, where readers are encouraged to check-out individuals, or human books, who volunteer to share their stories. Human books are typically community members who may have faced discrimination, but may also be persons with special hobbies or interesting experiences (Watkins, 2014). Though human libraries are often hosted in traditional libraries, they can take place in a variety of settings, including festivals, schools, and community centers (Wentz, 2012).
Human libraries bear resemblance to other library traditions of community knowledge representation such as oral history and community information services. However, information exchanges within the human library are more situated and interactional, and as such, these event can be seen as a form of participatory library service (Lankes, Silverstein, & Nicholson, 2007). By providing access to otherwise difficult to obtain knowledge embedded in community members, human libraries have the potential to generate new kinds of knowledge and experience sharing while providing new access into local history and cultural heritage.
The human library remains relatively underexplored in scholarly research. Most work has been focused on the presentation of case studies of specific events. Findings show positive experiences for both readers and human books, though note the identification and recruitment of human books as a particularly challenging aspect of these events (Kudo et al., 2011;Clover, 2014). Previous work has touched on the experiences of human books. Official guidelines for hosting human libraries indicate that human books can enjoy participating in the events and can even learn from their readers (Abergel, 2005). Previous studies covering human library events in general have noted that human libraries can offer human books the opportunity to explore identity (Clover, 2014), but also suggest that any benefits are likely to be very individualized (Constable & Harris, 2008).
More closely examining how human books benefit from the human library may hold important implications for the difficult task of human book recruitment, as well as hosting positive, successful events. In this study we focus specifically on the experiences of human books and offer a preliminary exploration of the various benefits they may ASIST 2016, October 14-18, 2016, Copenhagen, Denmark. Copyright is retained by the authors. gain from participation in human library events. Partnering with three different host institutions, we reviewed the exitsurvey responses of human books at four different human library events concerning their experiences. Our findings revealed eight major categories of benefit, including a number of self-focused benefits. In this paper, we present the results and discuss the implications of these benefits on the recruitment of human books and the goal of human library events. We also suggest future work to further develop recruitment strategies and increase participant satisfaction.
METHOD
We identified four human library events in our area, hosted by three different institutions: one by a local community group, two by a university library, and one by a community college library. These institutions were chosen for their regional location, history of human library events, and variety of settings. In addition, each institution conducted similar exit surveys with all human library participants.
These surveys employed open response questions, and were focused on collecting both positive and negative feedback from human books, as well as any suggestions for future events. With permission from our partnering institutions, we gathered human book survey responses from each of their most recent events. Participants totaled 69 human books (8, 13, 18 and 30 respectively). The different institutions employed slightly different exit surveys. For the purposes of this study, we focused only on the survey questions that were the same among the institutions.. As such, we collected response data for the following two questions: ""What were your experiences of the human library?"" and ""How did you benefit from participation?""
Responses were analyzed using a two-cycle coding methodology of initial coding and focused coding (Saldaña, 2013). In the initial phase, inductive coding was performed by a single researcher. Each response was reviewed and given a tentative code for any apparent benefit mentioned, coded at the sentence level; multiple codes could be applied to a single sentence. In the second phase, all generated benefit codes were reviewed, and with the assistance of a second researcher, an iterative process of focused coding was used to collapse the codes into a smaller set of major categories. All initial phase codes were able to be aligned within a final set of eight major categories.
RESULTS
Eight major categories of benefit were determined, ranging from altruistic to more self-focused (see Figure 1).
More altruistic benefits included helping others and teaching. Participants reporting helping others as a benefit enjoyed the chance to make a difference to someone through offering experiential or emotional guidance. As P11 stated: ""[readers] were interested in how I could help them -which was an interesting and appropriate view.""
The teaching benefit focused more on imparting specific knowledge or skills. For example, P3 enjoyed ""enlarging people's knowledge of quilting.""
The most reported benefit (30 participants) was the ability to make connections. Human books described connecting with their readers in several different ways. Simply meeting new and different people was of benefit. P10 summarized: ""it was a great way to meet a pretty diverse group of people."" Engaging in conversations with these readers was another beneficial form of connection. Though most connections were one time interactions, some human books established more ongoing connections with their readers. Six participants described recruiting readers into a group or social activity of theirs. P30 reported: ""perhaps even gained two new English Conversation Group leaders for next year!""
The more self-focused benefits reported by participants included learning, self-expression, reflection, therapeutic benefits, and personal enjoyment. Though human books hope to share their experiences and knowledge with the readers, 11 of our participants reported learning from their readers as a benefit. Human books gained a new understanding of readers' experiences and perspectives. P31 responded: ""I learned from them as much as I hope they learned from me."" Human books also benefitted from the opportunity for self-expression, simply enjoying the chance to talk about a topic of interest. P1 ""loved… talking about a favorite subject."" The chance to talk about their experiences conferred more personal benefits. Reflection, the reviewing or reliving of past experiences, was cited as a benefit. P5 benefitted from discussing past travel experiences, reporting: ""I get to recall my experiences and relive my trip."" Several participants also mentioned the therapeutic benefits of being a human book, describing participation as ""cathartic"" (P29) and ""very healing"" (P41). Finally, 7 participants reported personal enjoyment and fun as a benefit.
DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
As noted in the official guidelines, human libraries are designed to overcome differences within a community and bring people together (Abergel, 2005). Our study showed that human books benefited from contributing to these aspects of the human library. In helping others and teaching, human books enjoyed the feeling of sharing experiences and knowledge that could instill a positive change in the readers. Making connections was another benefit in line with the traditional goals of the human library. In meeting, talking to, and possibly recruiting readers into hobbies or social groups, human books were able to overcome social distances and make connections with community members.
However, many self-focused benefits were also reported during this study. Learning from the readers was an important benefit that supports the view of human libraries as interactional knowledge sharing platforms. The selfexpression, reflection, and therapeutic categories of benefit are intriguing and warrant further exploration and consideration. Together, the more self-focused benefits hold useful implications for the challenging task of human book recruitment. Host institutions may wish to promote the personal benefits of participation in the human library while seeking out books, for example, highlighting the opportunities for mutual knowledge sharing. Identifying community members who may benefit from reliving an interesting experience or talking about a personal difficulty may also be an effective recruitment route. Host institutions may even wish to adapt the human library, and consider offering events focused on allowing community members to reflect on past experiences together. Such events could influence how libraries approach cultural heritage and local history while providing new, beneficial participatory services to the community (Lankes, Silverstein, & Nicholson, 2007).
Our study represents a preliminary exploration of important aspects of human libraries for human books. More study across a larger sample is necessary to fully understand how benefits may vary among different types of human books, as well as to more fully develop recruitment strategies. Examining all of the effects of these events on human books, beneficial as well as negative, will provide deeper understanding of the needs of human books and how to plan for them. Similar examination of the readers should also be undertaken. Such research will provide further guidance on planning for human library events that will be mutually beneficial and enjoyable to all participants.
CONCLUSION
Human libraries provide readers with access to the knowledge and personal experiences of their fellow community members. Human books stand to benefit from participation as well, in various ways ranging from altruistic to self-focused. Traditionally, identifying and recruiting human books has been one of the most challenging aspects of hosting a human library. Potential benefits outlined in this study suggest new recruitment considerations, and imply new adaptations of the human library event. Increased awareness of the benefits for participants can promote human library events, while also providing insight into participatory community services in general.",1951,2141

While defining ""spiritual solidarity"" and its importance for students in a context of growing extremism, this article explores the impact of using a new teaching tactic: ""Human Books."" The pedagogical purpose of ""Human Books"" is to propose an interactive learning experience joining formation and information, where students learn through personal dialogue with people who have overcome challenges while impacting their community. This approach achieves a stronger student engagement not only at the rational level but also at a deeper emotional and spiritual level. It helps students to overcome their misconceptions and perceive spirituality as a platform of ""interconnectedness."" This process recognizes the richness and authenticity of each person's spiritual and theological experience. It provides a unique bridge to discover commonalities and spiritual solidarity through dialogue.
",2020-09,Teaching Theology & Religion,Wiley,"
To answer these issues, I will define spiritual solidarity in a university intercultural environment and describe the practice of ""Human Books"" and its impact on my students' experience of spiritual solidarity.
| Context
As teachers in a Christian university that adopts a liberal arts curriculum and believes in diversity, we are called to go beyond providing our students with an anchor for their spiritual lives. Our mission is to prepare them to live in a diverse society and overcome their resistance or misconceptions about others' beliefs inherited from recent wars.
Education aims not only to share information about other religions but more importantly to allow students to have experiences that can shape their future interactions with others. Our suggested classroom approach is based on introducing the students to the importance of spiritual solidarity which transcends a simple feeling of empathy, to discover its positive impact on their lives and their communities so they can heal the wounds of their own societies together.
Lebanon's history is marked by a millennium of interreligious coexistence that has shaped it to become a ""mosaic of religions"" (Fahed, 2012). It has also witnessed multiple conflicts among different cultural and religious groups; the same trend was observed worldwide during this century. This highlights the importance of building a sustainable peace by moving people from a narrow understanding of their own beliefs to a broader spiritual solidarity.
| Defining spiritual solidarity and its importance in teaching theology and religion
Spirituality is a broad concept that includes a sense of connection to something bigger than ourselves and involves a search for meaning in life. Spirituality can be ""personal or institutional"" (Eck, 1993;Roof, 1999) or ""multidimensional and pluralistic"" (Chang & Boyd, 2011). It can ""be driven by the head or by the heart. It can be mystical or doctrinal, it can be inspired by a sacred text or by a sunset"" (Chang & Boyd, 2011, p. 117). It can be a self-effacing altruism, a blissful transcendence (Greenwald & Harder, 2003).
Solidarity is a connection between different human beings; it is feeling with others, living with them, taking care of them and helping them. It is what binds people together even amid differences. Solidarity is essential in every society because it joins people together and ""is the fabric for all authentic relationships"" (Wright, 2017). ""It is not a feeling of vague compassion"" (John Paul II, 1987); rather, it enables all people to participate in and benefit from the common good. Solidarity encourages mutuality because the oppressed have their own perspectives, abilities, and spiritualties to share (Beyer Gerald, 2014). Solidarity is a spiritual process directing each person towards self-transcendence, to constitute others as part of oneself (Maruggi, 2012). Therefore, we can consider spiritual solidarity as recognizing ""the richness and authenticity of the other's spiritual experience"" (Schaeffer-Duffy, 2016). This spiritual solidarity is ""God-bestowed, incarnational"" (Nash & Bradley, 2008), furthermore it seeks to reconcile the students' world and priorities with their beliefs. Consequently, spiritual solidarity should have a permanent place in the university and in students' lives and seeks to meet the students where they are today within their own social environment and assist them to bridge over the gap. Accordingly, spiritual solidarity is an outcome of dialogue, a dialogue that should be translated into actions and this is what Leonard Swidler (2008) would call ""dialogue of the hands"" where we collaborate on the ""practical"" level through working together and joining our forces.
Faculty members and students are called to incarnate the meaning of spiritual solidarity by healing the wounds of their own societies and seeking to find, together, a response to the mystery of existence and promoting ""the true human dimension as a priority in their development plans"" (John Paul II, 1987). Spiritual dialogue should lead students to focus on the connectedness between spiritual commitment and nature, philosophy, literature and the needs of the world surrounding them, connecting the students to something larger than their own egos (Parker Palmer, 2003). The experience of Human Books is among the most effective practices that I have developed to teach spiritual solidarity within the classroom. The idea of the Human Books is to invite students to interact on an individual basis with a person that has a meaningful story to share rather than read a print book.
I have had the opportunity to launch and implement this teaching tactic at Notre Dame University -Louaize (Lebanon) for more than three consecutive years, which has allowed me to develop, test and adjust this pedagogical approach to the needs of the students' environments and social contexts. The Human Books experience allows ""learning"" to take place through joining formation and information (Jacobsen & Hustedt, 2011).
| The pedagogical purpose
The Human Books teaching tactic exercise was introduced to undergraduate students enrolled in a variety of majors and could easily be adapted to almost any course in religion and beyond. Its purpose is to allow students to learn through interacting with Human Books and then to interpret what they have discovered through their own lives; it allows them to reach a deeper level of engagement, not only at the rational level but also by experiencing a deeper emotional and spiritual connection.
| The concept of Human Books
The concept of the Human Books allows students to ""borrow"" a person who has a spiritual solidarity experience to share. For 25 minutes, they can sit with this Human Book and have a face-to-face, one-on-one discussion. In the first 10 minutes the Human Books will share their story and their own experience, then the 10 to 15 remaining minutes will be dedicated to a question-and-answer session and a direct discussion between the Human Book and the student. Unlike a print book, the Human Books are there to answer questions and tailor the storytelling experience to the person in front of them. This innovative model aims to create dialogue and understanding among people; moreover, its main target is to share the experiences and the challenges of others in their community and make them easier to understand. This creative dialogue can break barriers, open the students' horizons and forge new connections.
| Process
After introducing the students to the theoretical meaning of spiritual solidarity through readings, discussions and activities in the classroom (the academic and theoretical level), students are invited to participate in the Human Books event on a specific day. Students are encouraged to ""read"" more than one Human Book, to interact with different stories, and to discover the richness and uniqueness of the experiences in different fields.
An essential part of this process is the selection and invitation of Human Books who have a spiritual solidarity experience to share in an academic context and are open to discuss and answer the students' questions. Our personal network, our research in the field of peace building and our daily dialogue with the students play an important role in selecting Human Books that bring a rich variety of experiences.
Among the different Human Books selected we had: The life of a peace activist, the experience of launching a sustainable interreligious leaders' network, the life of an ex-war lord and his journey to become a peace builder, a life of serving God through serving others, life in a refugee camp etc. All the selected Human Books focused on how they were able to live, experience, promote spiritual solidarity and overcome their own challenges and prejudices to bridge gaps of misconceptions.
| Foundations of the Human Books initiative
Building spiritual solidarity is a journey that starts by understanding and addressing the misconceptions students have about other cultural communities. The second step is to engage the students through active learning and a multidimensional interaction. One of the best ways to do this is through the one-on-one personal connections that take place in the Human Books project. This experience can lead to interconnectedness where the students are invited to go beyond the classroom to identify commonalities and live the other person's life and struggles.
We built the Human Books initiative on the following three foundations:
| A platform to heal misconceptions
First, it was essential to begin this project by identifying the current beliefs the students had of ""the others."" This image is often incomplete, so an essential part of this initiative was to recognize and heal those misconceptions. In order to overcome these prejudices, we needed to help students question their own beliefs. Instead of learning about the others through indirect resources, which could increase different biases, our adopted teaching tactic using Human Books allowed the students to directly access and discover by themselves. This led to a more solid foundation for future learning by building the critical thinking capability and engaging the students.
Human Books were able to impact the misconceptions by sharing their own personal experience and answering different questions. The students were able to challenge their own assumptions and discover different realities from the one they imagined. Being immersed in the other person's universe and discovering them from within had a very profound impact on the students, allowing them to heal the destroyed images and correct the wrong perceptions of the other communities.
| A multidimensional approach for active learning
It is important to engage the students through an active learning approach that focuses on the interaction between people within their rich and diverse cultural environments. This is based on an active learning methodology that focuses on learning by doing, learning by interacting and discovering, and learning by connecting students to the realities and needs of their own societies. It allows concerned students to build their knowledge on solid foundations and become aware of the ""sensorial nature of sacred texts"" and that ""it is only in and through the senses that the world makes sense"" (Brent, Miller, & Dault, 2016, p. 212). The proposed tactic fully allowed this multidimensional approach by seeing, smelling, touching and being inspired by the different Human Books. Students are invited to experience spiritual solidarity not only intellectually but holistically, by living it and feeling it.
| An experiential platform of ""interconnectedness""
A central aspect for teaching spiritual solidarity is to guide the students to perceive it as a platform of ""interconnectedness."" The meaning the dictionary assigns to interconnectedness is simple: ""connect, one with another"" (Random House Dictionary, 1971, p. 740). While Macy (1989) describes interconnectedness on a more personal level in her paper, ""Awakening to the Ecological Self,"" she describes ""a transcendence of separateness … generating an experience of profound interconnectedness with all life."" Thus, interconnectedness can be seen on both a larger level, such as nations working together towards peace, and on a more individual level such as when students are guided to discover the deep connections between each other. The Human Books experience played a central role in allowing the students to discover the depth of their connections. For Hull (1998), ""spirituality exists not inside people but between them."" Spiritual education must promote the cultivation of solidarity and communion in a pluralistic society. He added, ""spiritual education inspires young people to live for others … and seek to recreate community through participation in the lives of others"" (Hull, 1998, p. 61). Solidarity then affirms a ""human interconnectedness while at the same time challenging each person to assume responsibility for the other"" (Maruggi, 2012, p. 309).
One of the main advantages of promoting interconnectedness within the classroom is to avoid solidarity being imposed ""from above"" because it will always be perceived as external, whereas true solidarity can only develop from ""internal relations"" (Piaget, 2011, p. 79). By sharing their own journey, the Human Books were able to share the power and the impact of interconnectedness in their own lives. This allowed the students taking part in this initiative to understand the place of classrooms and universities as microcosms of a larger social structure and work for changes in social realities that impede human dignity and social justice. Spiritual solidarity becomes, then, an endless meeting of self and others leading to a real transformation that will start in the classroom. Thus, the university will be filled with a new spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation, both intellectual and moral, leading the students to move from the individual to the universal (Piaget, 2011).
Finally, students were enriched through the classroom discussion that followed each session of this teaching tactic during which they discovered that each one of them was touched by some specific aspect of the same Human Book. It allowed a better understanding of the nuance and complex typology and the real dynamics of formation that occur in the classroom (Nash & Bradley, 2008).
| Impact of the Human Books and its contribution to students' life
In addition to the academic and pedagogical approach discussed above, the Human Books initiative was able to achieve a significant impact and contribution to students' lives.
Major themes and outcomes from this project included:
• Discovering others and understanding their beliefs: The participants in this experience were affected by the truth and the concreteness shared through the spiritual solidarity of the Human Books event. Narratives are pivotal in moral development because ""we learn more by stories than we do by rules"" (Gula, 1989, p. 142). Students heard stories, collected from different religious and cultural backgrounds, of real people sharing their own journeys and the challenges they have faced through living and promoting spiritual solidarity throughout their lives. This adopted teaching tactic showed that stories matter and that narrative are fundamental in the construction of human meaning-making (Clark & Rossiter, 2008).
• Deeper spiritual connection: The uniqueness of each Human Book, the one-to-one interaction, in addition to the eye contact and the private setting of the Human Books experience allowed the participants to go deeper in the exchange of ideas. It even helped the Human Books to go deeper in their own experience because they were exposed to a series of questions asked to them privately.
• Changing perception and self-reflection: While it is important to address the inaccurate perceptions students may have had of ""the others,"" and focus on the commonalities, it is equally important not to ignore the differences.
This happened naturally during this approach that allowed students to experience the different emotions and struggles faced by ""the other"" that they can closely identify with. It also allowed a critical reflection on the narrative encountered and on their own journey.
• Spiritual solidarity: Due to the variety of experiences of the Human Books, this project opened the student's horizons to perceive spiritual solidarity out of the purely religious context. It allowed students to discover the link between spiritual solidarity and today's society by addressing the most urgent and sensitive topics that are affecting their own lives such as: finding the meaning of life, facing injustice and violence, overcoming personal challenges, etc.
Beyond the discussed interest of this approach in transforming students' perceptions, it is important to assess how the students themselves perceived this experience.
| Assessment and students' perspectives
The exit surveys conducted at the end of each Human Books event over 3 years showed consistently that 95% of the students were ""very satisfied"" with this experience.
In addition, 99% of surveyed students shared that they would recommend this experience to their friends, which is an unprecedented level of endorsement of an academic initiative. Quotes from students highlighted: ""it was a life changing experience,"" ""this experience taught me to never give up"" ""it is one of my most favorite events at Notre Dame University"" etc. (Fahed, 2018).
The variety of topics covered and the personalities participating were very appealing to students and, as a result, 96% of the students responded that they would like to participate in this type of event every 2 to 3 weeks. This highlights the importance and possibility of using this approach not as a one-time initiative but as an integrated tool in the curriculum.
In terms of versatility, this teaching tactic could be used to approach multiple topics in the liberal arts curriculum in an impactful way.
| CONCLUSION
In Lebanese society, the involvement of schools and universities in teaching spiritual solidarity is still much needed.
This process, which recognizes the richness and authenticity of each person's spiritual and theological experience, includes ""the other"" and provides ""a praxis by which we might respond to the most pressing and immediate humanitarian crises of our day"" (Potter, 2009) such as developing solidarity with the most vulnerable people and marginalized communities. It invites the students to move from ""living on their own island"" to discover their interconnectedness and commonalities. It also demonstrates that by joining their own experiences and their critical thinking approaches, they can impact their local societies more positively while discovering also the richness of each cultural community. It opened the eyes of the participants to realize that solidarity is doable through concrete actions that reach out to the others.
The Human Books experience leads to a self-transcending ""spiritual"" connection to the other as one who shares a common humanity (Maruggi, 2012). This transformational learning experience generated strong changemakers cemented in spiritual solidarity that allowed enlightening and stimulating dialogue starting from the classroom and embracing the world.

Similar to discussions in social work education classrooms facilitated by Intergroup Dialogue (IGD), the Human Library (HL) is an opportunity for students to engage in personal one-on-one dialogue about prejudice, discrimination, and oppression. To date, no study has been conducted of the use of the HL in social work education. A qualitative case study approach exploring the perceptions of 11 participants in an HL event hosted by one midwestern university explored two research questions: How do those in the role of enlisted participants (Books) describe the HL experience? and What potential does the HL have to create IGD in the social work classroom? Data analysis revealed the following unique themes: (a) arriving with the baggage of the narrative, (b) intention to educate and raise awareness, (c) surprise at the undeserved respect they received from readers, (d) perception of a shift from monologue to dialogue, and (e) recognition of expanding the narrative that fueled positive self-perceptions. Freire's critical theory was applied to the findings, identifying the benefits of its use in social work education compared to more traditional IGD offerings.

It's not a storytelling event. It's about having difficult conversations with people who experience prejudice. We're not talking about our garden or our stamp collection. We like to talk about the things that hurt, the things that people are afraid to talk about. (Granger, 2017, p. 20) Since its inception in Denmark in 2000, the HL phenomenon has spread worldwide, operating on six continents and in hundreds of cities (Calderon, 2014). As originally conceived and as it has developed, the HL has similarities to the IGD process. Namely, it has the potential to address stereotypes, confront bias, and promote conversations related to power and privilege.
No studies to date have considered the use of the HL in social work education. Therefore, the present qualitative study poses the following exploratory research questions: (a) How do Books enlisted for HLs describe their experience? and (b) What potential does the HL have to create IGD in the social work classroom? Using data from an IRB-approved study about an HL event hosted by a midwestern university, and viewing it through the lens of Freire's critical theory (1996), the study considers how the HL can enrich social work education's focus on diversity.
Review of the literature
The existing research literature on the HL is limited. Watson (2015) pointed out that until 2015, only five studies, excluding magazine and newspaper reports about specific HL events, had been published on the phenomenon. These studies, as well as those that have been published since, have primarily focused on Books' self-reflections and Readers' attitudinal change. The following focuses only on the former, given the scope of the present study. The research question, How do Books enlisted for HLs describe their experience? resulted in the following general categories: (a) the self-reflective nature of HLs, (b) the impact of Books on Readers in HL events, and (c) connections with the larger community. Additionally, some studies have focused on the potential for HLs to create IGD, the focus of the present study's second research question.
The self-reflective nature of HLs
In their dialogues with Readers, according to the literature, Books increased their ability to be selfreflective. In Kudo et al.'s (2011) study of an HL event, Books used the phrase ""discovering the unknown self"" (p. 4) to describe this process. Ashmore (2010) also commented on this phenomenon. In her observation of the Lismore Living Library, 1 Books altered their understanding of their topics and what they meant to them because of their participation.
Impact of Books' narratives on readers
In addition to allowing Books to be self-reflective, HLs give them the opportunity to consider the impact of their narratives on their Readers. In their study of 17 staff members, 15 Books, and 38 Readers from events hosted at six public and academic libraries in the central New York region, Jackson et al. (2015) found that Books perceived that their presence allowed Readers to gain a different perspective on issues not typically discussed. They admitted their satisfaction with being able to help Readers sort through their own experiences. In the words of one participant, ""What I had dealt with and struggled through on my own was of value to someone else facing the same concerns [which] was a good feeling"" (p. 49). Similarly, Brown's (2016) anecdotal reporting of an HL event she hosted stated how Books' involvement made them feel valued, as if they were contributing to the promotion of tolerance and diversity.

The term Living Library, is an alternative to Human Library. Living Libraries tend to focus on a specific topic or population defined by its organizers and constituents, whereas Human Libraries are more broad based in scope. This article uses Human Library for both forms.
Connections with the larger community
Some reports of HLs have focused on Books' representation of and connection to the larger community. In her description of the Lismore Living Library, Ashmore (2010) noted that Books served as cognitive mediators to topics of importance to the community. Similarly, Pope (2013) reported that an HL on her college campus increased students' connection with diverse members of the community. Wentz (2012) observed the HL's penchant for helping public libraries form partnerships with community organizations. Such collaborations reinforce the library's value to the community. Lankes et al. (2007) labeled this aspect of HL as a form of participatory library service, whereby access to local history and cultural heritage is enhanced through the narratives of Books.
The promotion of IGD
These and other accounts have noted the potential for HLs to incur a sense of dialogue among participants. In their overview of implementing an HL component in the women's studies curriculum at Augustana College, for example, Blizzard et al. (2018) stated that the phenomenon facilitated opportunities for intergenerational and intercultural conversation between community members and students. Using data from qualitative interviews of 15 Books and event organizers in Australia, Dreher and Mowbray (2012) concurred in their assertion that an HL event can create a nonjudgmental atmosphere through its open conversations. According to Dreher and Mowbray, all participants in the HL are accorded equal status, which instills an interdependence that enhances knowledge production.
Finally, Dobreski and Huang (2016) listed a series of benefits articulated by Books in exit surveys from four HL events hosted by three different institutions. Eight major categories of benefit were determined, ranging from altruistic to more self-focused in nature. The former included helping and teaching others. More self-focused advantages of HL participation, as reported by participants, were learning, self-expression, reflection, therapeutic benefits, and personal enjoyment. The most reported benefit in their study was the ability to make connections.
Theoretical application

Justification for the use of critical theory
Researchers of the HL experience have suggested that Allport's (1954) contact theory is a credible lens for viewing its potentially positive impact on participants. As conceived by Allport, contact theory presumes that prejudice ""may be reduced by equal status contact between majority and minority groups in the pursuit of common goals"" (p. 281). Yet, the limited research that has been completed about the HL experience suggests that self-attitudinal change is more likely a measurable outcome of HL research than other-attitudinal change. Watson (2015), in fact, devoted a portion of his dissertation to explaining the limitations of applying contact theory to HL outcomes. He noted that anecdotally the phenomenon has made an impact on its participants, but research proving this assertion is inconclusive. The basis of Allport's contact theory is, do individuals in dialogue with each other truly alter their prejudices about each other and the groups they represent in a meaningful way?
If viewing the HL phenomenon through a contact theory lens limits its effectiveness as an active anti-ism strategy, a critical theory approach may be more instructive. Freire's (1996) pedagogy of the oppressed has implications for understanding the HL as an act of reflection and action with the potential of humanizing its participants. Freire's (1996) critical theory assumes that our knowledge of the world and ourselves is fashioned by the events that shape our ongoing understanding of the world. Based on his idea of liberation education, which stresses the mutual respect and egalitarian relationship between teacher and learner, the theory suggests that humans engage in an interplay of constructing knowledge with the aim of transforming action (Darder, 2002).
Freire's critical theory
This process, according to Freire (1996), is twofold: First, in an act of what he calls conscientization, the oppressed unveils the world of oppression and, through praxis, commits to its transformation. Conscientization is antithetical to the banking concept of education, whereby teacher and experts simply teach students and learners. According to that paradigm, students adapt and never challenge the teacher's expertise. Freire noted that an inductive learning approach that conscientization makes possible is part and parcel of the role of the progressive social worker: ""not only to stimulate and develop a permanent critical curiosity toward the world in themselves, but also to do so in those with whom they work"" (p. 7). Conscientization, through the act of critical self-reflection, transforms the dominant structure from within so that oppressed individuals can become ""beings for themselves"" (p. 55).
The second part of Freire's (1996) critical pedagogy emerges when it ceases to belong to the oppressed and becomes a pedagogy for all people in the process of permanent liberation. Here he draws on the concept of humanization. According to Freire (1998), humanization is not an individual pursuit and cannot occur in isolation. It occurs through communication and relationship. Freire (1996) makes clear that the interaction between the oppressor and the oppressed is a dialectic. Rather than being in opposition, the two depend on each other. According to Watson (2015):
Ultimately, within the relationship, the oppressor is dependent on the oppressed and this unmasks the falsity of oppression which is meant to offer the oppressor autonomous power. Similarly, because the oppressed are complicit with the oppressor in the oppression they are not simply innocent victims. (p. 96) In this act, the job of the oppressed is not to become the oppressor but to become ""restorers of the humanity of both"" (Freire, 1996, p. 26). Freire (1996) additionally suggests that humanization is not a destination but a process. The humanizing act that oppressors and the oppressed engage in is praxis, a synthesis of reflection and action that can ultimately result in meaningful change. In other words, ""Reflection and action [are] directed at the structures to be transformed"" (p. 106-107). Furthermore, for praxis to occur, dialogue must happen. Dialogue, as envisioned by Freire, has a clear purpose, structure, and direction, and it takes place within a particular context. It also must enable its participants to have an equal right to their voice. Freire's (1996) pedagogy of the oppressed has parallels to the philosophy of the HL as envisioned by its founders. Meeting in a purposefully constructed space, Book and Reader, as symbolic representatives of the oppressed and oppressor, respectively, engage in dialogue, which may initiate the act of praxis. It might potentially be for its participants ""a space . . . to reflect, critique, challenge, act, and ultimately transform . . . [a] collective understanding of the world"" (Darder, 2002, p. 82), a premise this study intends to explore.
Methods

Justification for methodology
In response to the dearth of literature about the Human Library experience, I used a phenomenological case study approach with the present study. In phenomenological research, the researcher identifies the essence of human experiences as participants describe them (Creswell, 2013). The researcher strives to obtain participants' perspectives and reports them from the vantage point of their own words, ideology, and constructs (Denzin & Lincoln, 2008).
According to Flyvbjerg (2006), case studies allow researchers to come to understand human phenomena because they learn best through context-specific examples. Creswell (2013) further noted that case studies explore in depth a program, event, activity, or process. For the present study, HLs were analyzed. Creswell also stated that cases are bound by time and activity. For this study, the bound activity involved individual interviews with Books in an HL event in a university library in an midwestern state.
Phenomenological case study methodology is a suitable approach to address the aforementioned research questions. Semistructured interviews culled participants' experiences in their own words, thereby giving meaning to the phenomenon of the Human Library. In addition, the exploratory nature of the study fits well with case study research's tendency to unearth new understandings and uncover nuances and complexities about a phenomenon (Flyvbjerg, 2006). Recognizing the limitation that case study research is not generalizable, the participants' experiences, as expressed by them, become the basis for exploring the viability of the use of the HL in social work programs more generally.
Participants and interview protocol
The present study used a convenience sample from one midwestern university. After receiving institutional review board approval, I obtained names of the 15 participants from the HL event on the university library site, the sampling frame of the study. Participants for the study met the following criteria: (a) they were 18 years of age or older and (b) they were enlisted as a Book for the HL event.
Participants under the age of 18 were excluded from the study.
About 1 week before the event, I contacted all Books who had been enlisted for the event by e-mail or phone, informing them of the research study and requesting their participation in it. I then set up individual interview dates and times (to take place within 1 month following the event) with those who responded. On the day of the event, I followed up in person with any Books who had not responded and requested their participation. At that time, I distributed the informed consent for the study. A total of 11 participants agreed to be interviewed for the study.
With the permission of the interviewees, I audiotaped all interviews, using a semistructured interview process. Data saturation was achieved. The interview protocol for the study is shown in the Appendix.
An independent vendor transcribed all audiotaped interviews. To ensure privacy and confidentiality, I asked all interviewees to either not use their names or invent pseudonyms. Only the transcriber and I had access to the written transcripts.
Data analysis
Data analysis for the study adhered to Padgett's (2008) open coding, the process of continual internal review. I first read all transcripts without making any markings on them. A second reading and marking of transcripts elicited general categories. I then classified the data pieces according to the category represented, keeping them malleable throughout the process. From this reading, themes emerged. A fourth reading of material related to each theme elicited subconcepts related to that theme.
Internal validity
Researchers have adopted measures of reliability and validity specific to qualitative research. Lincoln and Guba (1985) used the term credibility, which refers to the confidence that the results of the study accurately represent the phenomenon being studied. Among the several techniques used with qualitative research methodology, this study used peer debriefing and member checks. Creswell (2013) cited intercoder agreement as a form of peer debriefing, which contributes to the reliability of qualitative research. According to Creswell, reliability refers to ""the stability of responses to multiple coders of data sets"" (p. 253). In this study, I asked a peer to read all transcripts. The two of us discussed impressions and thoughts connected to the data, which helped me formulate the codes, categories, and themes elicited in the study.
Second, I member checked to verify the accuracy of the data. As Creswell (2013) explained, member checks involve ""taking the final report of specific descriptions or themes back to participants and determining whether these participants feel that they are accurate "" (p. 196). In the present study, I created a list of preliminary findings and asked selected individual subjects by e-mail to comment on them.
Limitations of methodology
This study contains limitations inherent in qualitative research, including a small sample size, researcher bias, and lack of generalizability, to name a few. Although 11 is a credible sample size for qualitative research, it in no way signifies the diversity represented by the experiences of people who are oppressed or participants in HLs.
I acknowledge bias in my interpretation of the data. Creswell (2013) describes this process as ""going native,"" (p. 60) whereby the researcher knowingly or unknowingly sides with participants on issues. He recommends consciously taking multiple perspectives when reporting the data. Despite the attempt to remain neutral in the analysis and reporting of the findings, internal bias will always exist.
Finally, the findings of the present study cannot be generalized to other HLs or social work programs. Nor does it indicate that one person's experience of oppression is in any way like another's. Moreover, there is no indication from the data that the HL event in and of itself caused attitudinal changes expressed by the Books.
Findings
Data collected from the study indicate a recognition that the Human Library experience offers unanticipated self-knowledge for its participants. For the Books interviewed, what began as discomfort about their narratives and a one-sided goal to raise awareness and educate became a mutual dialogue bolstered by the benefits of self-exploration and catharsis. This section discusses five themes from the study that provided evidence of this cognitive shift: arriving with the baggage of the narrative, planned intention to educate and raise awareness, surprise at the undeserved respect they said they received from Readers, perception of a shift from monologue to dialogue, and recognition of expanding the narrative that fueled positive self-perceptions. Quotes from the participants, designated by the letter B and the participant number, elucidate the themes.
Baggage brought to the experience
After reflection about their decision to participate in the HL, some Books admitted moments of discomfort initiated by past baggage about their stories. Such instances were often propelled by their unsatisfying experiences of telling their stories in the past.
A few Books arrived with stereotypes they assumed Readers would have about them based on their stories. B4, for example, carried his often experienced belief that people would be biased against the military and acknowledged that because of his Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, he has ""always been misunderstood with . . . [his] . . . facial expressions and body language. It's flat. Or, my face may seem like sad or depressed . . . when . . . I'm fine."" He worried that his Readers may not be able to read him as a result.
Additionally, Books noted their concern about reaching their audience at the event. B3 stated said he assumed many Readers were not part of the community he identified with (individuals with autism spectrum disorder). He said, ""I was [going to] have to keep steppin' out of my comfort zone, and, talk in a way that people wanted to listen, or wanted to relate, or felt comfortable with."" B6, similarly, feared that he might be perceived negatively by university peers in relating his story: ""I thought just because it's on campus, it might seem like I'm . . . against my university or against the other institutions that I was part of. I was also afraid to offend people, um while addressing oppression and stereotypes.""
Motivation to educate
One way that Books justified their participation in the HL and perhaps coped with the baggage they brought to the event involved their intention to educate their Readers. When asked why they agreed to participate, nearly all Books noted their desire to raise awareness on a topic they believed others knew little about.
B4 noted that he chose his story to ""help others feel like they are not alone."" B3 indicated his intention to give others exposure to someone living with autism. B5 came to the event to share ""something that . . . happens in my professional practice that maybe I . . . could shed a little bit of light on."" B7, recognizing the struggles she had experienced with her mental illness, intended to educate others on how she managed and coped. B9 believed that his self-exploration had the capacity to give insight to others. B10 hoped that his story would ""initiate advocacy, not only for myself, but for other people who are going through similar problems that I've gone through.""
Undeserved respect
Contrary to believing that they or their stories would not be embraced, the Books interviewed noted after reflection about the dialogs that Readers respected them. Most expressed surprise that so many Readers ""checked them out,"" as one of them put it, in the first place. At least three participants assumed their narratives would be controversial and thus not well received. On reflection, they noted the admiration they received. For example, B6 was struck by the recognition that there was no opposition to her message, ""only sympathy."" B1 concurred, noting that Readers were ""not as confrontational as I thought [they would be]."" B4, who assumed his Readers would be negative about his status as a veteran, felt validated by one specific eventgoer, who seemed to say, ""You don't even have to tell me your story.""
Other Books were surprised by the role the Readers took in the dialogues. B3 noted an unexpected role reversal that demonstrated respect: ""Usually I'm just a conveyor. And here somebody was teaching me something."" B11 did not expect patrons to request to hear the chapters of her story.
From monologue to dialogue
As stated earlier, Books came to the HL event with a story to tell, along with a specific motivation to share it. The one-sidedness of this expectation quickly became dispelled, as the Books soon recognized that the experience became an equal sharing opportunity, which offered numerous and unexpected benefits for them. Some Books were surprised to learn that their Readers wanted to share more than listen. On the whole, they embraced this phenomenon rather than resisted it. B5's reflection is typical: They really didn't [want to] hear what I had to say so much as they needed somebody to listen to what they had to say on the same topic. . . . And so I . . . listened to them, because they needed their voice to be heard just as much as anybody else does.
Similarly, B8 stated that his problem (a rare disease) was more universal than he thought. Although others were not diagnosed with the same disease, they were able to point out similarities in their experiences. He said, ""Looking back, maybe my story was more important than I thought it was.""
At least half the Books used the phrase ""establishing common ground"" to describe their interactions with their Readers. The result was that the story, in B6's words, became ""bigger than just her."" Sharing her experience of gender and sex oppression, she noted, ""Even women [who don't] look like me, or identify as the same race as me still go through similar struggles. So that was eye-opening because I've never really thought about it like that."" B2 stated that the experience made him realize that ""LGBTQ people are still individuals at the end of the day. There are some things we share in common with other LGBTQ people and straight people."" B3 had a similar experience regarding his living with autism: ""Finding that common ground really connects people to . . . Autism . . . without them having to know that person.""
Books furthermore cited the personal benefits they received from sharing common ground. B3 perceived the experience as an opportunity to ""feel understood."" Reflecting on what his Reader shared in response to his narrative, he noted, ""I'm hearing the story back and I'm connecting it to something that's very similar to what I went through. . . . I have somebody who gets me, and I get them."" B11 used the HL to challenge her stereotypes about those younger than she: ""Regardless of our age gap, they were curious . . . [which] showed the serious side of this generation."" B3 perhaps best summed the Books' recognition that they learned something about themselves through intentional dialogue: ""A validation, where we say almost, 'Me too.' Not to empathize or sympathize, but to just be liked as I am with another human being.""
Expanding the narrative
Despite occasional moments of discomfort and, perhaps in some cases, because of them, Books recognized that their stories changed because of their participation in the HL Project. Details were added, elements they believed were less important emerged as such, and overall, they achieved greater clarity about their narratives.
This perception was not always positive. B1, a victim of sex discrimination, was reminded through the dialogue that there were other instances in which she was taken advantage of because of her sex. B5, who shared a similar story at the event, stated, ""Not a lot has changed over the years. Some of the stories that other people were giving . . . the exact same things are still happening.""
More likely, the newfound recognition Books came to about their narratives was positive. Telling their stories was validation that the work the Books were doing outside the Human Library setting was worthwhile. For B6, being part of the Human Library project was a reminder that her efforts to empower inner-city youths were making a difference. She noted, ""I always think about this, but the event [made me realize], okay, I really stepped out there and did something."" B4 and B11 saw the progress they made in confronting self-perceived flaws through their participation. B4 realized that he was more resourceful growing up than he originally thought: ""And I was like, man, I was a pretty decent kid."" In a similar vein, B1 telling her story validated her ""strength as . . . a mother, and as a young wife."" She stated that the Readers saw herself in a positive light and ""I really have not confirmed that myself.""
This perceived self-validation in part came from the belief that the Books were helping the Readers come to new insights. B7 said: I loved the idea if I even talk to one person who feels like they got something out of this conversation, even if it's just a sense [of] it turns out I'm not alone in feeling weird about this thing . . . that will totally make like, worth it. B8, as well, noted the cathartic element of the experience for his reader: ""Maybe like a cleansing . . . in terms of . . . this is stuff [that] you repress.""
A sentiment expressed by at least two participants was the realization they have ""moved beyond"" the issue that brought them to the event. B7 expressed this belief as she reflected on sharing her struggles with depression: ""If felt like something that is more in the past. Like I was telling a story like this happened. It's not happening now."" She added, ""Like this isn't so much a part of my present as maybe I sometimes hold onto, and think it is."" Similarly, B6 admitted that being a Book made him realize that the had become ""accustomed to . . . certain behaviors that are not okay."" This awareness, while uncomfortable, was confirmation that ""there was a purpose for me [being] at this event. And, in general, there's a purpose [for] me being on this planet.""
Discussion

Freire and the transformation of narratives
Data analysis of the study's findings suggests that the movement from the first iteration to the second iteration of themes signifies a cognitive shift in the Books who participated in this HL. This transformation offers insight into the phenomenon's self-reflective nature, which informs the first research question, How do those enlisted as Books describe their HL experience? Freire's critical theory (1996) is an apt lens to view this cognitive shift. The following describes how this pedagogy played out in the event.
The HL offered the opportunity for Books to engage in a conversation unique from that outside the HL space. Reflections about what the Books brought to the event suggest that the pre-HL exchanges they had about their topics were silenced, diminished, or even abusive, experiences akin to being marginalized. Therefore, they often refrained from telling their stories. Such negative past experiences contributed to the surprise many of the Books shared when they sensed Readers' openness and willingness to be active listeners. In whatever way it was perceived by the participants, this encounter was fundamentally different from what they had experienced before.
This understanding naturally opened the Book to the act of conscientization. Acknowledging the conversation as a dialogue and not a monologue initiated an inductive learning process, whereby the teacher or expert versus the student or learner dynamic was transformed into one inhabited by colearners. On reflection, Books viewed their stories as narratives that incurred not opposition, not even sympathy (usually), but common ground with their listeners. Unlike their experiences outside the HL forum, the Books perceived that the Readers were not co-opting their stories but cocreating them. The Books' ability to share how their narratives had shifted and grown as a result of their encounters with the Readers demonstrates acknowledgment of this cocreation process and corroborates the literature about the impact of the HL on its participants.
It is important not to overlook the discomfort the Books experienced in this encounter. In different ways, the Books in this study spoke of stepping out of their comfort zones, often precipitated by their own biases in what they believed the Readers were bringing to the event. These are natural responses that ultimately ""keep the oppressor dependent on the oppressed,"" according to Freire (Watson, 2015, p. 96). Working through this discomfort curtailed the Books' tendencies to allow the Readers to construct meaning for them.
Similarly, the Readers, at least as shown by the perception of the Books, were disempowered without becoming victims themselves. In effect, the dialogue itself became fodder for a new narrative. Books were provided with a model of engagement that rejected objectification and came close to mutual dialogue, where participants had equal rights to their voices (Watson, 2015). Readers were given permission to empathize with the experiences of Books and, in the process, see themselves in the Books' stories.
Applying Freire's critical theory (1996) to the HL phenomenon provides a framework that builds on the literature about HLs. The outside world's silencing of a Book's narrative gives way to the cocreation of a new narrative, where Book and Reader engage in uncomfortable, yet potentially empowering dialogue. The model additionally informs social work educators who hope to have difficult conversations about discrimination, privilege, and oppression in the social work classroom, the focus of the second research question of the present study.
The HL's ability to promote IGD in the social work classroom
The following compares the potential outcomes of the HL, as articulated by the Books in the present study, to the use of IGD in social work education noted in the literature. In effect, the HL has the potential to address three shortcomings of IGD: the inadvertent reinforcement of the privilegeoppression dynamic, the partiality toward knowledge acquiescence and away from empathy taking as a way to gain access to one's biases, and the tendency to silo marginalized and privileged as separate identities.
Addressing the inadvertent reinforcement of the privilege-oppression dynamic
Research has found that IGD facilitators can negatively affect participants' experiences. For example, they can inadvertently reinforce the privilege-oppression dynamic by what they choose to challenge and not to challenge in the group setting (Miles et al., 2014). For example, Dentato et al. (2014), in their discussion of an IGD on sexual orientation identities, found that the amount of non-LGBTQ social work student support may be reliant on the level of the LGBTQ student's outness and vice versa. Students who identify with the LGBTQ spectrum may be inhibited by the perceived lack of reciprocity among their classmates.
The data from this study indicate that the intimate setting of the HL, in which one-on-one private conversations ensue, prompt individuals to take risks that may not surface in large-group IGDfacilitated discussions. The perceived reciprocity of the dialogue shown by this study promotes a nonjudgmental atmosphere, as found by Dreher and Mowbray (2012) in their HL study, which may enhance social work students' willingness to share their experiences of discrimination or oppression in the social work classroom.

The advent of globalization, workforce mobility, and international projects are generating demands for culturally proficient individuals and post pandemic there is scope of creating awareness of diversity & inclusion across globe using technology. Education, training, and development of these employees begin in the webroom now (Van Dyne,  Ang, Livermore, 2010).Diversity and inclusion efforts tussle since they often attempt to find a one-size-fits-all solution to eradicating bias. The Human Library is making an influence, because their approach is personalized to each individual's own biases and prejudices. They're tackling diversity and inclusion one person at a time and now with advent of technology they can do it on a large scale and see the benefits.The main drive of this paper is to examine whether the education system plays an important role in developing an individual with an open outlook without any discrimination, stereotypes, and prejudice and the important use of the human library as a tool to develop this open outlook. The research objectives of this paper include focusing on the theoretical and practical concepts of emotional intelligence, stereotypes, discrimination, prejudice and establishing a relationship between these concepts and the human library utilizing thorough literature review and consolidation.
",1954,,,"INTRODUCTION
In India, multiple committees on education have recommended areas of improvement. A notable change is not reflected in education yet except in the top-ranking B-schools. It is essential to investigate and address the important components related to education in India which will enable the corporate to optimally utilize the demographic dividend provided by our country especially post pandemic a sensitized workforce with evolved mindset to different perspectives will be essential. The important parameters include a emphasis on the eminence of faculties, promotion of faculty development programs, facilitating research, developing evaluation systems based on individual and team appraisals, strict corporate governance of all the management institutes, focus on institute-industry interface, emerging a global mindset, the style of teaching pedagogy and innovative and informative library set up (NEP, 2020). This paper explores the innovative and informative library set up with a focus on the human library concerning the use of the human library as a tool to develop the open outlook without any discrimination, stereotypes, and prejudice in students a pre-requisite for the advancement of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence indicates that one is conscious of one's emotions and can identify, manage and control emotions of self and others leading to self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management.
In the educational institutions whenever any topic is taught related to behavioral sciences focus must be there on behavioral modification (as performance reinforces behavior) and pedagogy should be redesigned to provide scope for implementation of the modified behavior with associated rewards and recognition to make teaching a productive process leading to students, faculty and educational institutional progress.
The major purpose of this paper is to investigate whether education plays an important role in developing an individual with an open outlook without any discrimination, stereotypes, and prejudice and the important use of the human library as a tool to develop this open outlook. This paper aims to examine the role of the human library in an open outlook without any discrimination, stereotypes, and prejudice in students a pre-requisite for the development of emotional intelligence. The research objectives of this paper include focusing on the theoretical and practical concepts of emotional intelligence, stereotypes, discrimination, prejudice and establishing a relationship between these concepts and the human library utilizing thorough literature review and consolidation.
LITERATURE REVIEW
The purpose of this section is to present an overview of the research streams under investigation in this research paper. The areas of diversity in India, human libraries, stereotypes, prejudice, discrimination, and emotional intelligence are discussed in the context of human library intervention in educational institutions to broaden the outlook of the students and smooth transition from the classroom to corporate.
DIVERSITY IN INDIA
India's diverse workforce largely depends on how well it's tactically managed for the effectiveness of the organization. India is one amongst the varied countries within the world. Its variety factors are rooted inside the socio-cultural elements and rising developments in demography. The kind of dimensions are mentioned below heads: sociocultural dimensions and demographic dimensions. Diversity symbolize Indian society and culture. So, stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination are certain to be a derivative of the range in India ensuing in narrowing the outlook of the students, for this reason it is vital to recognize how the human library is a device to develop the outlook of the students to increase emotional intelligence and compassion.
STEREOTYPE, PREJUDICE, AND DISCRIMINATION
Prejudice is a preconceived idea that is not supported on basis of any reason or experience (Jones, 1972). Stereotypes are psychological feature schemas employed by social perceivers to process information regarding others (Hall, 2019). Stereotypes do not solely replicate beliefs regarding the traits characterizing typical cluster members however additionally contain information regarding different qualities like social roles, the degree to that members of the cluster share specific qualities (i.e., withingroup homogeneity or changeability), and impact emotional reactions to cluster members. Stereotypes imply a considerable quantity of knowledge regarding folks on the far side of their directly apparent surface qualities and generate expectations regarding cluster members' anticipated behavior in a new context (Oakes &amp;Turner, 1990).
Discrimination might involve actively negative behavior toward a member of a bunch or, additional subtly, less positive responses than those toward an ingroup member in comparable circumstances. According to Allport (1954), judgement involves refuting 'individuals or groups of people parity of conduct which they may wish' (p. 51).
For example, prejudice and discrimination supported race is termed racism. Oftentimes, gender prejudice or discrimination is observed as discrimination. Discrimination is commonly the end result of prejudice-a pre-formed negative judgment or perspective. Prejudice leads individuals to look at bound people or teams as inferior.
HUMAN LIBRARY
The Human Library is meant to make a constructive framework for conversations that may challenge stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination. Created in Copenhagen in 2000 to boost awareness and use contemporary's education to mobilize Danish children against violence, the Human Library initiates an individual to perceive diversity as one thing that binds humanity along and makes one stronger, to look beyond only labels, to interrupt down prejudices and see the story behind the stereotype (Nosek,2004).
Human Library introduces real folks in an exceeding sort of book to a reader. The reader will choose between many various titles including ex-drug addict or a Muslim lady or a transgender or rape victim, to have interaction (Imai, 2010). The reader will gain necessary insights directly from the human book and that they will exchange experiences throughout the time given.
'The Human Library is a concept for interaction among those who might not typically get the prospect to own a conversation: it will increase understanding between folks and challenges prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination (Putnam,2007).
RESEARCH DESIGN
The type of research conducted is qualitative in approach focusing on thorough literature review and consolidation.
DATA COLLECTION METHOD
The data collected is secondary, based on published and unpublished paper and electronic sources like research articles, journals, newspapers, etc.
FINDINGS, DISCUSSION, AND IMPLICATIONS
The human library can help educational institutions to develop emotionally intelligent and compassionate individuals so that stereotype, prejudice, and discrimination will not negatively impact the culture of any organization and organization as a whole will develop a positive outlook encompassing, recruitment, selection, appraisals only on a merit basis creating goodwill and brand image of the organization.
Following are the findings, discussion, and implications connected to the human library intervention:
THE BEHAVIOR TO FEELING TO THINKING
As teaching faculties sometimes, we follow a thought process that we can dictate and control the change but most of the time that is not the scenario due to the above fundamental truth.
There are three dimensions in the learning process -Thinking (change in knowledge), Attitude (Change in feeling), and Behavior (change in practice focusing on controlled willed behavior). In the human brain, there is always consistency in the 3 elements of the learning process. The majority of change methodologies are focused on only one of the 3 elements especially on the cognitive thinking part (80%) focusing on grasping knowledge and giving information be it teaching, advertising, corporate seminars, etc. If this is the scenario then after the exposure to a particular change methodology, we find it difficult to retain the knowledge and the entire session becomes just a waste of time and unproductive. The actual transformation occurs only if all the 3 elements thinking, attitude and most important behavior are transformed and that is the major challenge in the educational scenario (Kanfer et.al., 2008).
The human library thrives on this concept of behavior to feeling to thinking leading to realistic transformation or change in an individual.
Utilizing developing human libraries focused on certain stereotypes, prejudice, or discrimination for example divorce, drug-addict, transgender, etc. a compassionate outlook can be developed among students.
COMPASSION
Happiness is not connected to external virtues like name, fame, wealth, etc. It is internal wellbeing that is essential. Having all the external world information and knowledge but no internal connectivity leads to an imbalance that needs to be addressed as mentioned by many researchers (Burns, 2019). A person can be happy by achieving happiness by the process of transformation through the mind. It is essential to be conscious of ourselves every moment. For this, it is essential to be aware of the emotions that are created in our minds. Our mind comprises of black and white, negative entities and positive entities or destructive elements and constructive elements. We have to cope up with these negative elements to transform. One always blames other individuals, external situations for one's negative emotions. It's one's mind that carries these negative emotions giving one a feeling of one being the slaves of these negative emotions.
An individual cannot get up in the morning and say he is jealous and so he is happy. Jealousy is an unpleasant emotion and so one cannot benefit from it and one reacts destructively as one cannot control it. Compassion or any positive emotion and jealousy or any negative emotion cannot run simultaneously in our minds. If one is conscious about themselves, their emotions, what makes them happy, and what makes them unhappy they can recognize the pattern and learn to control and manage the same for their selfbenefit. The human library allows one to experience it. Many people feel this is just a philosophy that can be practiced by saints in the Himalayas (Click et. Al, 2017). One can practice this every moment of our life if one is conscious of their emotions. Review the emotions, find cause and effect, you will find the destructive elements, be aware of them, recognize them and identify them. This will enable you to find the techniques to manage them, through practice, learning's, willpower, and effort. There is no need to move in isolation or a cave to practice the same you can do it at home, at your workplace, while you are walking. Just be watchful with your mind, realize the negative emotions which dictate you, it will make you conscious to manage them. You will yourself feel at peace due to the same leading to your development as a better person who is compassionate. This will enable you to connect to others, society as a positive person (Kulik and Metz,2011).
Being a selfish person leads to our disconnectedness with our society, organization, family, and selfleading to the feeling of loneliness and accompanied depression and stress. As a compassionate person, we are responsible for global, national, and local issues and streamline our thoughts and extend our hands in taking part in solving these issues that will lead to the feeling of connectedness. For this action it is essential for mankind to realize the reality of the inner world and the external world and how both are dependent on each other, this will enable us to understand the importance of transformation. The human library can work on this principle.
All over the world researchers, scientists are paying attention to this kind of transformation of an individual into a compassionate person. Mindfulness now has become a global phenomenon increasing the importance of emotional intelligence to be successfully happy. PRACTICE and self -experience is essential for this individual transformation and need of the hour as any institution that has the emotionally intelligent staff, teams, management, and system in place is more productive and more profitable (Koster, 2010).
Human Libraries allow to generate this philosophy of compassion utilizing live interaction with humanwww.psychologyandeducation.net focused on their life story explaining how they dealt with stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination.
Human Library and its relationship with Stereotypes, Prejudice, Discrimination, Emotional intelligence and Compassion
Invitees to a Human Library are given the chance to speak informally with ""people on loan""; this latter group being extremely varied in age, sex, and cultural background. The Human Library empowers groups to break stereotypes by challenging the most common prejudices positively and humorously. It is a concrete, easily transferable, and affordable way of promoting tolerance and understanding.
All books tell a story, and these human ""books"" aren't an exception. Since the primary Human Library in Copenhagen, events have spread everywhere across the globe. The Lismore City Library in Australia now has regular ""Lismore's Living Library"" days on their schedule, and also the Human Library Organization has partnered with the Hope Institute in Asian country for 2 major events next month. In India Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore are the places where such have slowly started gaining momentum virtually during pandemic The simplicity of the Human Library concept generates instant appeal to would-be organizers. However, there's way more to contemplate if one wishes to become a Human Library organizer. It's essential to understand exactly what the Human Library is, and maybe more importantly what it's not, to deliver a successful event or project. It's very difficult to possess up to prejudice, and even tougher to expect someone who holds a robust prejudice to confront it publicly. In reality, one in all the largest barriers faced when trying to challenge prejudice is that the word itself -Prejudice. Nobody wants to be seen as prejudiced. Nobody wants to grasp anyone who is prejudiced. Individuals value more highly to ignore it, to pretend that they are do not have any prejudices, and wouldn't associate themselves with anyone who does. Most are frightened of the word and its connotations. The Human Library could be a novel way of addressing the broad issue of prejudice while navigating around a number of the associated sensitivities. At a Human Library, prejudice, stereotype, and discrimination are at the root of the methodology and thus 'out within the open'. It's alright to have prejudices, talking about the same and challenging the assumptions & beliefs is important. The method of using the human library is borrowing an individual's Book, and sitting down for a conversation. Apart from the very fact that Books are people, the Human Library is incredibly almost like regular librariesan area where one can learn, improve and interact with others, where one can discover new worlds, people, and ideas (Ramula et.al, 2010). The difference is that the Human Library is ready up for a particular purpose: to facilitate a conversation which will result in a change in behavior. Put simply, individuals are encouraged to take a seat face-to-face with their stereotypes, prejudice, discrimination, and talk. By facilitating this interaction, the Human Library can make a positive contribution to addressing stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination.
LIMITATION OF RESEARCH
This study is focused on qualitative data using a thorough literature review and consolidation. Future research can be conducted utilizing actual design and testing of human library intervention in educational set-ups in India followed by quantitative analysis of the data obtained over a long period.
The other limitation is obtaining actual humans and providing a climate of trust and openness in which they will be ready to share their stories without inhibitions and it is not an easy task.
SCOPE OF FUTURE RESEARCH
The human library can be set up at educational institutes and longitudinal time-series studies can be conducted to understand the impact of the human library on student's transformation. Along with the development of emotional intelligence, the role of the human library in developing cultural intelligence can also be investigated in the future.
CONCLUSION
In India incidences of stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination are common due to in general social context and diversity. This leads to conscious or unconscious bias concerning different functions in organizations like recruitment, selection, appraisals, leadership, etc. for example leader-member exchange (Burke et.al, 2005). Educational systems play a major role in the transformation of an individual. The main source of information in the case of educational systems is the well-equipped library. One such concept human library can play a major role in developing a broad outlook of the individuals concerning biases resulting out of stereotyping; prejudice and discrimination. This broad outlook can enable future managers and entrepreneurs to enhance emotional intelligence and compassion, much-needed virtues to be productive in both professional and personal life.",3196,3607
10.1002/casp.2402,,,False,Agata Groyecka,Challenge your stereotypes! Human Library and its impact on prejudice in Poland,"
Human Library is a public event aimed at reducing stereotypes and prejudices, in the form of an interactive, contact-based intervention. It employs the logic of a regular library yet with readers ""borrowing"" Living Books, which are real people representing various minority groups. Readers engage in 30-min conversations, during which they can challenge their stereotypes and widen their scope of knowledge and understanding. This pre-post intervention study examined the effectiveness of the Human Library (held in Wrocław, Poland) in reducing social distance towards Roma, Muslims, dark-skinned, and transgender people, as well as in decreasing homonegativity. Also, we measured whether participation in the Human Library changes individual attitudes towards diverse workgroups. We found that the Human Library decreased social distance towards Muslims. Also, the more Living Books that the participants ""read,"" the bigger the shift in their social distance towards Muslims. Furthermore, we observed an increase in positive affective attitude towards working in diversified groups, as a result of participation in the event. The study serves as partial support for the effectiveness of the Human Library in altering one's attitude towards minority groups and diversity.The intervention is discussed as a promising but not yet entirely understood tool to improve intergroup relations.
",2019-03-24,Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology,Wiley,"| INTRODUCTION
Poland constitutes an interesting case in the study of intergroup relations. Some scholars argue that the incremental conservative shift over the past decade that took place in the Polish political arena accompanies a particular increase of xenophobia and prejudice (Stefaniak, Malinowska, & Witkowska, 2017). It is still one of the least ethnically diverse countries of the European Union and its citizens rarely have opportunities to confront their stereotypes in a real contact situation (Eurostat, 2015). The vast majority of respondents of the Polish Prejudice Survey in 2017 declared very rare contacts with people of other race or ethnicity. Also, many claimed not to know a single homosexual person (Stefaniak et al., 2017).
The problem of discrimination against minorities in Poland is broadly discussed, also on an international level (Grell, Köhler, Pankowski, Sineaeva, & Starnawski, 2009;Selinger, 2008). In the past few years, numerous acts of verbal and physical violence motivated by hate and prejudice towards various minority groups have caused an increase of attention drawn to the scale of homophobia, xenophobia, and racism. (Buchowski, 2017). According to the report of the National Prosecutor's Office, 1,449 proceedings for crime committed on racist, anti-Semitic or xenophobic motives were registered in Poland in 2017. Amongst victims, Muslims were the most highly represented group (328 cases). In over 200 cases, the reported motive of the crime was ""propagation of the fascist state system"" (Polish National Public Prosecutor's Office, 2018). In recent years, the level of islamophobia in Poland has increased (Górak-Sosnowska, 2016), probably driven by associating Muslims (and consequently all Islam believers, driven by generalisation) with terrorist attacks as suggested by the media discourse.
The social acceptance for homosexual people in Poland is one of the lowest in the European Union (Brewer, 2014). According to research conducted by the Public Opinion Research Center (CBOS), over 60% of Polish respondents claim that homosexuals should not have the right to get married, adopt children, or even publicly express their lifestyle (Public Opinion Research Center, 2017a). Over 50% of surveyed homosexuals report to have had moderate contact with anti-gay (-lesbian) hate speech. Over 60% of each of the following groups-gay men, lesbians, bisexual men, bisexual women, asexual people, and transgender people-report to have experienced violence during the past 2 years with the highest prevalence of verbal violence and threats (Świder & Winiewski, 2017). The anti-gay attitude was manifested by banning the Equity March in 2004 and 2005 (the Polish equivalent of Gay Pride; O 'Dwyer & Schwartz, 2010).
LGBT is not the only minority group towards which a vast percentage of the Polish society remains prejudiced. One of the excluded ethnic groups in Poland are the Roma (the Poles are yet not exceptional, see Pew Research Center, 2014). There are, depending on the source, between 17,000 and 30,000 Roma people in Poland, being present in most larger cities. Although they have been present in Poland for centuries, they are systematically excluded from the dominant society in schools and in the labour market (Marczak, 2016). According to the Polish Prejudice Survey 2009 (Winiewski, 2009), Poles report the highest social distance towards Roma people, compared with six other target nations (Germans, Russians, Belarussians, Ukrainians, Vietnamese, and Jews). In 2017, the only less accepted groups were Muslims and refugees (Stefaniak et al., 2017). Roma are commonly perceived as dishonest, lazy, and willing to cheat (Winiewski, Witkowska, & Bilewicz, 2015). According to various sources (Nowicka & Krzyżowski, 2017;Public Opinion Research Center, 2017b), Poles report the highest aversion towards Arabs and the Roma, yet according to (2017b), their attitude towards the latter has slightly improved since 2016.
The abovementioned discriminatory behaviours and attitudes towards several minority groups in Poland depict different aspects of moral exclusion. According to Opotow's theory (1990), moral exclusion results from a constricted scope of justice, that is, narrowing the context in which moral conduct would be expected. Scopes of justice may differ across individuals and groups and can be changed beyond conditions. Their boundaries result in the moral inclusion of those social targets, who would be considered within this scope and, therefore, granted with fair treatment. The remaining, morally excluded social targets are beyond one's moral concerns, therefore eligible for harms and ignorance.
Moral exclusion underlies deconstructive conflict and can justify human rights violations (Opotow, Gerson, & Woodside, 2005). Achieving peace, defined not only as lack of war but also as a process of maximising justice, equity, and respect for human rights (Opotow et al., 2005;Reardon & Cabezudo, 2002) requires creating conditions that facilitate a shift from moral exclusion to moral inclusion. In practise, applying moral inclusion in peace education can be executed in different forms, such as implementing education about human rights, gender equality, and coexistence. The latter, also called diversity-, or multicultural education, addresses the fact that groups in conflict clearly justify excluding opponents from their scope of justice (Opotow et al., 2005). The main task of educating about coexistence is to replace stereotypes, dehumanisation, and moral exclusion, with tolerance, cooperation, and moral inclusion (Opotow et al., 2005). The Human Library project described in this paper is an example of a combination of education for human rights and coexistence.
| Contact-based interventions as a way of reducing social distance
One method to address education about coexistence is through direct intergroup contact. Research on intergroup contact, originated by Allport's contact hypotheses (Allport, 1954) suggest that attitudes towards other groups can be influenced by direct (yet not exclusively direct, see: Vezzali, Hewstone, Capozza, Giovannini, & Wölfer, 2014) contact. The hypothesis assumed that in order to have a presumed impact, the contact should take place between groups of equal status, it should be sanctioned by institutional support, and furthermore, it should lead to common interests of the two groups members. Although, according to further research, these assumptions turned out not to be requisite, the contact situation seems to be especially effective when supported by authorities and institutional norms (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Another wide-ranging meta-analyses by Pettigrew and Tropp (2008) revealed that this type of contact reduces prejudice by increasing knowledge about the outgroup, reducing anxiety about intergroup contact, and increasing empathy and perspective taking. Interestingly, a positive experience of contact is not only generalised from people who personally take part in an encounter but also influences other members of their groups (Miller, 2002). It can also indirectly impact more positive attitudes towards outgroups, which are not represented during the contact scenario (Pettigrew, 1997).
Although Poland is a homogeneous country in terms of ethnicity and religion, the number of foreigners coming to live and work there is rapidly growing each year (Cianciara, Goryński, & Seroka, 2016). In this realm, there is a growing need to maintain social conditions that peace endures and to support moral inclusion. Specifically, such conditions foster individual and societal well-being and, therefore, prove to be beneficial for the minority as well as the majority part of the population (Opotow et al., 2005). Addressing social categorisations and intergroup conflict, challenging the status quo, is needed to combat social injustice. A meta-analytical approach to the evaluation of stereotypereducing and prejudice-reducing interventions (e.g., social-cognitive training and intergroup-contact based programmes) suggests that they might indeed to some extend be successful in improving intergroup relations, with direct contact methods being more efficient than indirect ones (Beelmann & Heinemann, 2014;Lemmer & Wagner, 2015; see Paluck & Green, 2009, for a review of prejudice-reducing interventions).
| Human Library
The Human Library has been conceptualised as an arena for intergroup contact with the exact purpose of a direct and extended reduction of prejudice and xenophobia. The initiative was developed by a group of Danish activists in 2000, and since then, it has expanded to 83 countries (information from organisers). Human Libraries create opportunities for conversation with a person representing a minority group, which is discriminated against due to his or her ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, political views, and so forth. The concept of the Human Library employs the logic of the regular library, in which users are allowed to request a book of their choice under certain conditions.
In the Human Library, members of minorities play a role of the ""Human Book"" and are ""borrowed"" for conversations, during which they share their personal histories. ""Readers,"" in turn, are allowed to ask anything that they are interested in (as long as it is comfortable for the Living Book; however, they are trained volunteers who are prepared for answering questions that might be both intimate, aggressive, or uncomfortable). Usually, the Living Books not only represent a wide variety of backgrounds including religion, ethnicity, and sexuality but also their lifestyle choices and viewpoints. There are two types of Human/Living 1 Libraries, open and dedicated ones. A dedicated Library is one organised solely for members of a certain group (e.g., students, policemen, and teachers), whereas a public Library is open for everybody who would like to participate in it (Abergel, 2005).
Although Human Libraries are organised in many countries, entering schools, and public spaces, empirical evidence for its impact remains scarce. To our knowledge, there has been only one published attempt to verify whether the Human Library (in fact, Living Library) fulfils its assumptions. Orosz, Bánki, Bőthe, Tóth-Király, and Tropp (2016) researched whether Hungarian teenagers taking part in the Human Library intervention changed their attitudes towards Roma and LGBT people. The study revealed a significant difference in perceived social distance and other forms of prejudice towards both groups. Assuming that the event was dedicated solely to high school students, it remains unknown whether such a positive effect could appear also as a result of an open to public Human Library. Furthermore, the groups towards which the shift in attitudes was tested are rather limited considering the problems with discrimination that the multiple minorities in Eastern Europe struggle with. Finally, Hungary and Poland are two independent countries with slightly different histories of migrations and relations with the European Union, and they require separate approaches to evaluating antidiscriminatory interventions. In summary, the study by Orosz et al. (2016) gives an idea but not a clear answer to the question of how does the Human Library work in Poland? As the outreach of the project intensifies, more and more organisations attempt to organise such events, making it highly purposeful to evaluate its impact and establish factors that adhere the beneficial role of conversations with Living Books, in improving intergroup relations. To this end, we measured the influence of an open Human Library in Wrocław, Poland, on attitudes towards gays and lesbians, transgender people, Muslims, dark-skinned people, and the Roma. Also, we measured whether a general attitude towards diversity might change as a result of participation in the Human Library. As personalising the outgroup and enhancing the knowledge about its members can reduce stereotypes, we hypothesised that talking to Living Books will change attitudes towards minority groups and diversity in general.
| METHOD
The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Before participation, all respondents provided an informed, written consent. They were allowed to stop anytime. The participation was anonymous.
| Procedure and participants
The study composed of Poles who took part in the Human Library, held in a public library on June 9 and 10, 2017, in the city of Wrocław. The event was open to the public. All participants could borrow as many Living Books as they wanted, being able to speak with them for a maximum time of 30 min, in groups of up to five people. However, most of the participants took part in one-on-one conversations, sometimes engaging a third person as a translator in case of a non-Polish-speaking Living Book or Reader. All participants agreed with the code of practise of the Human Library. The ""titles"" to be borrowed were the following: Atheist, Person that recovered from bulimia and anorexia, Ex Prisoner, Feminist, Freegan, Gay (2), Hindu, HIV + Person, Mother of Gay, Muslim man, Muslim woman, German, Transgender Person, Person with schizophrenia, Black Person, Deaf-blind Person, Ex-addict, Lesbian couple, Roma, Syrian, Sober Alcoholic, Ukrainian, Person on a wheelchair, Vegan, Sikh, Mother of disabled child, and Jew.
After expressing their willingness to participate in the Human Library, but prior to the first conversation with any Living Book, we asked the Readers to fill in a set of paper-and-pencil questionnaires consisting of prejudice measures and demographic data (sex, age, and completed education). They were asked whether they perceive themselves as also belonging to a group prone to stereotyping. Moreover, participants were asked to share their e-mail address so that the experimenters could invite them take part in an online follow-up survey-second part of the study. Four rewards were drawn (three pairs of headphones and loudspeakers) amongst participants who completed both before and after part of the study.
A number of 204 Readers filled in the first part of the study, and 87 responded to the second e-mail survey. Thirty participants did not share their e-mail addresses, and 87 did not accept the invitation to participate in the online survey.
The final sample comprised 87 Readers (66 Females) with the mean age of 27.1 (SD = 9.76). A number of nine subjects reported completing primary education, 27 high school, two vocational education, and 48 higher education. Regarding the place of residence, seven participants reported living in a countryside, 10 living in city below 50,000 inhabitants, and 69 living in cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants; 40 respondents reported that they also belong to groups with a high proneness to stigma, 10 did not answer this question. Seventy-seven percent (67) of the respondents participating in both parts of the study took part in the Human Library for the first time, 14 for the second time, four for the third time, and four for the fourth time. Thirteen participants had conversations with the Roma book, 15 with the Transgender book, 18 with one of the Muslim books, 22 with one of the dark-skinned books (Syrian, dark-skinned person, Muslim, and Sikh) and 45 with one of the homosexuality related books (couple of Lesbians, one of Gays or Mother of Gay).
Amongst those who did not complete the second survey, there were 60 women, and the mean age was 23.5 (SD = 9.7). Eighty-three percent (96) participated in Human Library for the first time. Whereas 54 of them claimed not to belong to any socially stigmatised group, 43 claimed to do so, and 19 did not answer.
| Measures

| Social distance
We used the Bogardus Social Distance Scale (Bogardus, 1933;Wark & Galliher, 2007) as a measure of prejudice and acceptance for minorities-a broadly used scale, also amongst Polish respondents. We adapted a four-item scale to assess the closeness to which participants would accept members of the four minority groups-Muslims, Roma, darkskinned, and transgender people. The questions concerned minority members living in the same country, working in the same workplace, living in the same neighbourhood, and marrying somebody from the close family of the respondent.
The respondent rated the social distance on a five-point Likert scale-1 (I fully disagree) to 5 (I fully agree). The questions were asked in a way that a higher score indicated a lower level of social distance towards the members of a minority group. The scale had good internal consistency for all of the groups (Roma-Cronbach's alpha pre = 0.92, Cronbach's alpha post = 0.92; transgender-Cronbach's alpha pre = 0.86, Cronbach's alpha post = 0.88; Muslim-Cronbach's alpha pre = 0.94, Cronbach's alpha post = 0.91; dark-skinned person Cronbach's alpha pre = 0.80, Cronbach's alpha post = 0.96)
| Homonegativity
A separate scale was used to assess the attitude towards sexual minorities-gay men and lesbians. We used a shortened nine-item version of the Modern Homophobia Scale (Raja & Stokes, 1998), one of the subscales in Intolerant Schema Measure (Aosved, Long, & Voller, 2009). Items included, for example: ""Lesbians should undergo therapy to change their sexual orientation,"" ""Movies that approve of male homosexuality bother me,"" or ""Gay men want too many rights."" The items were back translated by two bilingual translators. Specifically, the original version of the questionnaire was translated into Polish, and after that, it was translated back into English. The differences between the original version and the back translation were discussed, and there was a mutual agreement on the most appropriate translation. Participants answered on a five-point Likert scale-1 (I fully disagree) to 5 (I fully agree). A higher score indicated lower homonegativity, hence higher acceptance. The scale was successfully pretested on a Polish sample (N = 109). The scale had good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha pre = 0.86, Cronbach's alpha post = 0.84).
| Attitude towards diversity
In order to assess a general openness to diversity in the environment, we used the Attitudes Toward Diverse Workgroups Scale (ADWS; Nakui, Paulus, & Van der Zee, 2011). The scale was developed to assess how workers feel about minority coworkers and supervisors. It comprises of two subscales, affective and productive. The productive subscale reflects the perceived productivity of diverse workgroups (example item: ""The experiences of group members who come from different countries can be helpful in groups that are trying to generate novel ideas""), whereas the affective subscale refers to feelings about potentially working with people from different backgrounds (including items such as: ""I prefer to socialise with people from my own ethnic group""). Both subscales are related to the general level of prejudice (Nakui et al., 2011). Participants were asked to think of any group they work with on a daily basis (e.g., at school or at work) and to rate on a five-point Likert scale their agreement with the statements-1 (I fully disagree) to 5 (I fully agree). A higher score indicated higher acceptance of diversity in a workgroup. A diverse workgroup was described as a group, members of which are diversified in terms of ethnicity, country of origin, religion, knowledge, age, or sexual orientation. According to our pilot study (N = 109), two items were negatively correlated with the rest of the scale, and they were erased from the questionnaire used in the study (""It is easier to be motivated when working with people who are like me"" and ""In general, I prefer socialising with people like myself""). The scale was successfully pretested on a Polish sample (N = 109) and had good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha pre = 0.78, Cronbach's alpha post = 0.82). The Cronbach's alpha of the scale in a pilot study was 0.88.
| Control variables
In the second (online) questionnaire, participants were asked to list number and titles of Living Books they spoke to during the Human Library, as well as their sexual orientation.
| RESULTS
To test our hypotheses that the Human Library intervention would reduce prejudice, we performed a series of repeated measure ANOVAs examining the differences between participants' attitudes before and after the intervention. We compared the means of all participants that took part in both parts of the study, regardless of the titles they read. Means and standard deviations for each prejudice measure are provided in Table 1.
| Measures of prejudices-Social distance and homonegativity
The repeated-measure ANOVA revealed a significant shift in social distance towards Muslims, F (1, 86) = 5.95, p = 0.02, η p 2 = 0.07, that is, participants declared lower social distance after the intervention. We did not observe a significant shift in social distance towards dark-skinned people F (1, 85) = 0.01, p = 0.94; Roma F (1, 86) = 1.90, p = 0.17 Additionally, we tested whether the number of Living Books read by the participants correlates with the shift (posttest-pretest score) in attitude. The correlation was significant only for attitude change towards Muslims (see Figure 1) and revealed that the more conversations a ""Reader"" had, the bigger the change was (r = 0.23, p = 0.02).
| Attitudes towards diverse workgroups
Further analyses were aimed at examining the general effect of participating in the Human Library intervention on the acceptance of diversity in one's environment. To this end, we also performed a repeated-measure ANOVAs, comparing general attitudes towards diverse workgroups as well as the perceived productivity of diverse workgroups (productive subscale) and affective approaches towards diversity in the workgroup (affective subscale) before and after the event.
Participation in the Human Library intervention did not affect neither general attitudes towards diverse workgroups  participants displayed a more positive affective approach towards the idea of diverse workgroups, than they did before the intervention, F (1, 85) = 4.39, p = 0.04, η p 2 = 0.05.
Additionally, we tested whether the number of Living Books read by the participants correlates with the shift in general attitudes towards diversity, which did not prove to relate in a significant manner.
Participants who did not complete the second (online) survey revealed lower social distance to all target groups (for transgender and darkskinned persons, p < 0.001; Muslims, p = 0.06; Roma, p = 0.21), had a lower level of homonegativity (p < 0.001) and more favourable attitudes towards diverse workgroups (for both subscales ps < 0.05). See Table 1 for descriptive statistics.
| DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Our study's aim was to assess whether an open Human Library held in Poland resulted in a change of social distance towards minority groups, homonegativity, and attitudes towards diversity in workgroups. The results showed that participation in the Human Library significantly changed the preferred social distance towards Muslims. The shift in homonegativity was insignificant. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the respondents' scores on the affective subscale of the ADWS (Nakui et al., 2011). There was no significant difference between the pretest and posttest social distance towards Roma, transgender, and dark-skinned people. Finally, the more the subjects ""read"" (i.e., talked to the Living Books), the bigger the shift in social distance towards Muslims. Our results suggest partial support for the effectiveness of the Human Library as a way of changing one's attitude towards minority groups and diversity.
One reason as to why we noticed shift only on the affective, and not the productive subscale of ADWS (Nakui et al., 2011), might be that in order to change one's mind with regard to the effectiveness of working in a diverse group, one should probably actually experience working in such a group. In this case, observing a very diversified group of people (Living Books, Librarians, Human Library organisers, and other readers) and talking to some of them were not enough to cause an increase in the assumption that diversity might contribute to more effective outcomes.
On the other hand, voluntary involvement in informal, unstructured conversations that stemmed out of curiosity, did in fact make people like working with others from different backgrounds more, which hypothetically may increase their future willingness to work in diversified teams and, subsequently, foster multicultural integration. Library was the first direct experience they ever had with a Muslim person.
The effect of the Human Library on homonegativity amongst heteronormative people who talked to Living Books related to homosexuality (gay persons, lesbian couple, and mother of gay) was insignificant. The intervention proved completely ineffective for attitudes towards gay men and lesbians. In order to run the analyses on only heteronormative respondents, we had to exclude 34% of the sample. Therefore, the remaining sample size was relatively low (N = 57). The comparatively high percentage of nonheteronormative people suggests, together with the fact that 43 respondents reported that they belong to a group prone to stereotyping, that our sample was not representative of the Polish society. Willingness to attend such an event likely indicates that a person is already interested in the topic of minorities, prejudices, and stereotypes. Reducing social distance and prejudices in a group, which initially should be more open to others than their peers, is perceived as even more challenging than in a group of people with a higher level of social distance and prejudices. As shown in Hodson's review (2011), this type of direct contact not only works within individuals who are likely to be prejudiced (high on prejudices-prone individualdifferences variables such as Social Dominance Orientation or Right Wing Authoritarianism) but may also actually be more beneficial for them compared with more tolerant people. We believe that the characteristics of our sample entail that the effect of the Human Library is less clearly visible as in the case of a previous study on the effectiveness of the Human Library conducted on school children (Orosz et al., 2016).
Finally, a reason to why attitudes have changed towards Muslims and not towards other minority groups, might be that of the origins of given prejudices. Although negative attitudes towards the Roma, LGBT, and dark-skinned people were present in Poland for a long time (Górska & Mikołajczak, 2015;Mikołaj Winiewski et al., 2015), the topic of Muslims has gained attention only recently, regardless of their minimal presence in Poland. Prejudices towards this group are mediated by intergroup anxiety (Stefaniak & Bilewicz, 2014). Therefore, prejudices towards Muslims are not that strongly ingrained, suggesting they are easier to shift as they may depend on media, rather than on real contact, whereas
Roma and LGBT are indeed present in Poland. Our results are also in line with previous studies testing changes in attitudes of Polish students towards Muslims, as a result of direct contact during student exchange programmes (Stefaniak & Bilewicz, 2014). Additionally, our results show that Muslims constituted the most distant group amongst all other target groups to begin with. This also suggests high vulnerability to interventions (lower ceiling effect).
Interestingly, the comparison between participants who took part versus ignored the second part of the study show significant differences in their attitudes. In general, those who filled in the second part of the survey were less prejudiced. We see two issues potentially related to this matter. One is that there may be an even stronger effect of the Human Library on those with initially higher levels of prejudices that we were unable to detect. The second is the possibility that our participants were answering in a socially desirable manner, which is a limitation of most studies based on self-ratings. The future path to solve these problems may be to ensure a higher motivation to complete the study, or to consider measures of prejudices being other than self-rating.
Another interesting research direction is to examine the influence of the characteristics of Living Books on the effectiveness of the intervention. Personality traits may indeed determine whether contact with another person can be classified as negative or positive. Furthermore, a broader context in which the Human Library takes place, for example, socioeconomic situation in the country, size of the city, and level of initial prejudices/social distance, may determine how participants' attitudes are affected. In our study, we used a social distance scale transformed into Likert format as a measure of prejudice, which is a commonly used adaptation of the original Guttman scale developed by Bogardus. The scale assumes distance as a relatively static attitude representing a person's perspective towards an outgroup and desired proximity at a certain point of time. In fact, this interpretation of social distance is derived from a more dynamic concept by Simmel (1921Simmel ( , 1964) ) who viewed distance as an interplay of the near and the far-one can be in a close proximity with others but at the same time be excluded from membership. Following this interactive and dynamic perspective, outgroup perception can be negotiated through social interactions within specific settings and can be expressed not only by declarative fixed statements but also by subtle differences in behaviours and individualised perceptions of the outgroup members (e.g. Hodgetts et al., 2011). Viewing social relationships through this more dynamic and individualised lens, could allow a clearer view of the effect of interactions within Human Library in its higher complexity, because each participant enters the event with different background, assumptions, and affinity to the interlocutors. Therefore, we view interview and observational methods as a possibility for a more in-depth exploration of intergroup relations dynamics in a specific context of a Human
Library. We believe that the Human Library serves as a field to conduct both quantitative and qualitative studies, not only for testing how contact affects attitudes but also to examine which prejudices are prone to be reduced by interventions in a given society.
Our study suggests that the Human Library may be beneficial for intergroup relations and reducing social distance, but more research is needed to establish when and how it can be actually effective. Overall, we provide evidence that organising Human Library events is a promising way to increase tolerance. It can be, therefore, seen as an example of education for coexistence, being an important element of peace education (Opotow et al., 2005).
Through direct contact with stigmatised individuals, the Human Library can increase general knowledge about them and change the affect towards working with people who are different. Despite its challenges, like language barriers, working in diverse workgroups has multiple advantages over homogeneous groups. For example, it may result in more original, complex and innovative ideas (Milliken, Bartel, & Kurtzberg, 2003). Interestingly, interventions to reduce cultural prejudices in workgroups at school can boost creative thinking (Vezzali, Gocłowska, Crisp, & Stathi, 2016) suggesting that working in a culturally diversified group can have additional benefits, other than the reduction of stereotypes. The partially confirmed effectiveness of the Human Library suggests that it can be a step towards the integration of an increasingly diversified society.",6580,7408

The human library is an event intended to engage members of the community in sharing and learning from each other's experiences, and is growing in popularity internationally. Human libraries fall within the larger scope of community knowledge sharing but have received little study and remain largely unsupported by technology. In this study, we examine how community libraries organize and host these events. We present how libraries have attempted to utilize technologies and leverage community support to enable human library events. Our findings reveal inconsistencies in the purpose of human library events, as well as technology applications that are not sufficient to support fully collaborative community knowledge building. We highlight opportunities for increased community participation and technological innovation and also suggest a broader consideration of computer-supported collaborative work in the context of human libraries and experience sharing.
",2017-02-25,Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW),ACM,"INTRODUCTION
Community knowledge sharing and expertise sharing provide ways for members of a community to solve problems and engage within the dynamic collective of their community or information ecology on an interpersonal level [3,49]. The human library is a newly emerging practice intended to involve and engage communities in community knowledge building. Human library events facilitate one-on-one conversations between people from diverse backgrounds so that they can share experiences and learn from each other [72]. Human library events began in Denmark in 2000, with the goal of breaking down barriers in communities and providing a public voice to Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

They have since gained popularity internationally in countries such as Australia [37], Canada [55], China [56], and the United States [54]. These events utilize the metaphor of a library, where instead of checking out books, readers borrow individuals, or human ""books,"" who volunteer to share their own stories and experiences [2]. Though human libraries can take place in a number of settings, traditional libraries have proven to be popular host institutions [19]. Within physical libraries, human library events fall under the broad range of communityoriented services [41], where community members are turned from consumers to library service providers. Such new, userdriven library services are typically stimulated by the incorporation of new technologies, e.g., social media [51,15]. However, there have been relatively few studies examining human libraries, and the use of technology in facilitating and supporting human library events has been particularly underexplored. Many libraries or host institutions rely on a combination of traditional web technologies including websites and email [45]. Libraries have sought to use technology to provide access to information and the experiences of their served community in various ways, including through community information services [12] and oral histories [33], though these services differ significantly from the human library. Human library events may be also hosted by other institutions that lack traditional library infrastructure, e.g., community centers. The overall disparity between social activity and technological support suggests the presence of an important, unaddressed social-technical gap [3].
CSCW '17,
Additionally, hoping to reduce prejudices within the community, human libraries represent a new way of building and sharing community knowledge, which works to enable people to learn lived experience from their fellow community members. Ackerman et al. provide the computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) view of knowledge management by addressing two generations of research: knowledge sharing (artifact based) and expertise sharing (actor based), respectively [4]. CSCW and groupware have examined how knowledge management has sought to leverage communities of practice [67] and its core of expert members, formalizing such recruitment in professional organizations [66]. In human libraries, librarians may seek to establish their own search for and access to local knowledge. It is unclear to what extent knowledge management solutions -traditionally geared towards addressing internal culture in organizations [4] -can be applied to human libraries.
Based on this, we sought to investigate current understanding and practices concerning human library events. In this paper, we present a study of five different host libraries, utilizing interviews with the organizers, interviews with the human books, and observations of the events to explore opportunities and challenges that these institutions face. In particular, we aim to address the following questions: What work needs to be performed to create a human library? What social issues are involved? How are technologies applied and/or what technologies are needed to enable effective coordination of a human library? Our findings reveal important variations in the purpose of the human library, as well as collaborative and technological gaps in the overall process. Reflecting on our findings, we discuss the need for new, collaborative solutions, as well as how existing CSCW approaches can help this new form of participatory service.
RELATED WORK
Below, we first present an overview of the literature concerning human libraries. We also review related work by placing human libraries in the broader context of information ecologies and community knowledge management.
Emergence of the Human Library
The human library was originated by Danish activist Ronni Abergel in 2000 as a means of confronting prejudices through conversation [1]. Typically, the human books available for checkout comprise community members who have faced discrimination due to a particular identity, experience, or perspective. Through conversation with the readers, it is hoped that stereotypes and barriers within the community may be broken down [72]. Human library events have also been referred to as ""living libraries"" [2], though ""human library"" has emerged as the prominent English term for these particular programs. After their introduction in Copenhagen, human library events spread through Europe and soon saw international implementation. In 2006, the Lismore, New South Wales Living Library project became the first permanent human library installation, with events occurring monthly [37]. Human library events soon debuted in North America, in the United States in 2008 at the Santa Monica Public Library [54], and in Canada in 2009 at the University of Guelph [55]. Human libraries have also been hosted by a number of colleges and universities in China [56,75]. Today, human library events have been held in more than 70 countries around the world [1]. Though human library programs are well aligned with the mission of traditional libraries [72], they take place in a variety of settings including festivals, community centers, galleries, and schools. Though no standard electronic platform exists for hosting a human library, programs typically rely on a number of technologies, for example, websites, sign-up software, and email [45]. Variations exist among different human library events. Though originally designed to feature community members facing discrimination, ""how-to"" books have become common at human library events, sharing knowledge of specific skills [71]. Human library events have also been conducted to draw attention to specific social problems, including homelessness [73] and mental illness [43].
The concept of the human library remains somewhat underexplored in current scholarly research, with most literature focusing on case studies of specific events. For example, Clover presented a case study of a human library program at an art gallery, aimed at exploring the impact of the program on readers and books [18]. Findings showed that participants regarded it as a valuable opportunity to discuss the problematic notion of ""others"" while exploring identity, gender, and art. Constable and Harris conducted research on a series of human library events across four English libraries, to explore best practices and benefits of human libraries [19]. Results showed positive participant experiences overall, though also suggested the benefits of human library participation are likely to be very individualized. A 2011 study of a human library program at a Japanese university found increased knowledge, understanding, and self-reflexivity among participants, while also highlighting the difficulties faced with recruiting human books: approaching potential books was socially challenging, and coordinating with them required thousands of emails in a university setting [40]. Though much research into human libraries is practice-based, theoretical examinations of the human library have also been conducted. For example, Garbutt examined social theories in relation to human libraries including intergroup contact, cosmopolitanism, and listening theory, and proposed they be utilized as lenses in evaluating the success of human libraries in achieving their social goals [29].
In our study, we seek to identify major steps in the process of coordinating human libraries and the current use of technologies in each step, so that we can address the potential need for new technologies for effective coordination of human libraries.
Libraries as Information Ecologies and Facilitators
Nardi and O'Day viewed a library as constituting an information ecology, i.e., ""a system of people, practices, values, and technologies in a particular local environment"" [49]. They suggested that in an information ecology the spotlight should be on human activities, instead of the technologies that are meant to support the human activities [49]. Subsequent works have reinforced the notion of libraries as interactive information ecologies. Lankes, Silverstein, and Nicholson framed libraries as facilitators of conversation and urged librarians to adopt participatory network strategies that have come to be associated with Web 2.0 technologies [41]. Casey and Savastinuk presented a guide to library services, where users are involved in creation or evaluation [16]. Nguyen, Partridge, and Edwards outlined five factors constituting these kinds of library services including technological, human, educational, socio-economic, and environmental factors, and noted the corresponding barriers that may prevent participation [51].
Prior CSCW research has addressed a variety of library issues, including: understanding the impact of policies on technical and social activities [17]; examining how content is assembled and vetted in digital libraries [64]; and discussing the library's role as information intermediary [69,24]. However, these studies were conducted in the context of digital libraries
Session: Challenges in Sharing Experiences
CSCW 2017, February 25-March 1, 2017, Portland, OR, USA and focused on the collection of digital content [20]. A recent CSCW study showed that librarians can facilitate public dialogue by providing an on-demand fact-checking service [39], illustrating the effectiveness of librarians serving an inter-mediator role in a participatory service.
Our study contributes an understanding of the social issues involved in creating the human library and an exploration of how these issues challenge the applications of existing technologies.
Community Knowledge
The human library aims to promote experience sharing among community members, allowing information and interaction to be placed within a geographic context. In this section, we briefly review two traditional library services for community knowledge sharing as well as their social and technological considerations. We also provide related literature in CSCW regarding knowledge management.
Community information services involve libraries collecting information concerning programs, services, organizations, and expert individuals in the community, and often compiling them into vertical paper files [12]. In 1992, the MARC Community Information format was approved, allowing libraries to enter community information into modified bibliographic records for insertion into their existing electronic catalogs [11]. A number of libraries embarked on projects using the new MARC format to include community information in their catalogs, both in public settings [59,26] and academic settings [44,25]. Though the MARC Community Information format continues to be updated, many libraries and library vendors have moved away from it, a trend that is attributed to some extent to the proliferation of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s [61].
A second relevant, traditional library service for community knowledge sharing is oral history. Oral history is a method of recording and preserving the experiences of individuals, usually in the form of an audio-recorded conversation between a researcher and an individual narrator. Subjects of oral histories are usually persons who have witnessed or participated in a historic event. As a practice, oral history has been significantly affected by technological affordances, gaining in popularity in response to the availability of inexpensive recording technologies and digital storage [74]. Oral histories form an important part of archives and local history departments at many libraries in both public and academic settings, and it has been shown that they can serve to increase interest in local history in the communities served by these libraries [6].
In CSCW literature, expertise sharing focuses on the way in which discussions among knowledgeable actors can help get work done or problems resolved [4]. Its emphasis on individual engagement in interpersonal communications is aligned with the interests of the human library [4]. Expert locating technologies have been found to facilitate communication and bring people together [23], but they pose challenges such as balancing the needs of representation and access with privacy in the creation of profiles [60]. Expert finding and knowledge sharing practices of online communities associated with QA sites [70] and wikis [48] have also been explored. However, most of the sharing studied was problem-oriented and directional, e.g., [42,58,47].
Part of knowledge management's toolkit is its use of storytelling [21], where knowledge sharing is seen as a way to pass on ""tacit"" knowledge [62] from one group of workers to another. For example, a mobile app, called EatWell, was designed for people who had low income to share nutritionrelated memories so as to support each other in eating healthfully [32]. It showed that emotions were important in this kind of experience sharing [32]. Human libraries, representing a new way of storytelling or experience sharing, aim to break down barriers in communities. Our study examines how this new context impacts community knowledge sharing.
METHOD
We identified six human library events scheduled in our region, hosted by five different libraries representing different types of communities. The first library is part of a large university, with human books and readers being mostly librarians and students. The second library is in a middle-class and wealthy community, with Caucasians representing the majority. The third library is in a relatively poor area that is constituted mostly of African Americans. The fourth library is located in a conservative community with several churches nearby and serves many senior citizens. The last library is associated with a community college. These institutions were chosen for our study because of their current human library events, regional location, variety of settings, and history of hosting other human library events. Before we reached out to event organizers, this study was approved by our university's institutional review board (IRB).
In order to better understand the process of hosting human library events, we interviewed six librarians from the five host institutions before human library events from March to April 2016. In addition, we interviewed a seventh librarian who serves as a director for a regional library resources council and has been involved with assisting libraries in organizing human library events. Of the seven librarians, six were female and one was male. Interviews with the librarians were focused on their experiences and perspectives in organizing these events. During these interviews, we covered the following questions: Why were they interested in hosting a human library? What criteria did they use for the recruitment of human books? What tools did they utilize when they recruited and organized the human books and readers? If not using a tool, then how did they recruit human books? What methods or tools did they use to advertise the event? What were their concerns or suggestions about organizing human library events? All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed.
We also interviewed six human books who had each participated in an event at one of the five host institutions. The human books, four male and two female, represented various topics. Interviews with the human books were focused on learning their stories, revealing their attitudes towards the human library, and understanding their motivations to participate. Again, interviews were audio recorded and transcribed.
In addition to interviews, we participated in all human library events as both readers and observers. Through it, we were able to gain deeper insight into participants' perspectives of the human library and their concerns or suggestions about the event. We recorded detailed observational notes during and after the events regarding the environment of the library, the ambiance of the human library event, and our impressions of the human books.
Coding and Data Analysis
To analyze our interview results, we conducted a thematic analysis. Thematic analysis is ""a method for identifying, analysing, and reporting patterns (themes) within data"" and is commonly used for qualitative research [9,8]. First, all of the researchers in our project read the interview transcriptions and observational notes, and then we conducted several rounds of discussion on these materials. Second, two co-authors in this paper served as coders. They manually and independently coded the interview transcriptions and observational notes at a fine-grained and sentence level.
Due to the fact that our research in human libraries is largely exploratory without a pre-defined theoretical framework, our coding process was inductive. Codes emerged through an iterative process of coding and reconciliation between two coders with an initial subset of interview results. In addition, coders discussed initial findings with other members of the research team, and codes were collapsed via a collaborative process. The resulting codebook reflects a process-based approach. In effect, the major identified themes correspond to important steps in the process of hosting and participating in a human library event (as shown in Figure 1). Once the codebook was established, the coders independently coded all remaining interview transcripts and observational notes. Through a subsequent reconciliation process, coding reached an acceptable level of agreement (greater than 90%).
FINDINGS
We first present our librarian interview results to simulate the flow of human-library event organization. It should be noted that the flow is not necessarily linear and not every event includes all of the components. Following this, we present the results of interviews with the human books.
Event Purpose
Though there is already a formal definition of the human library [72], our interviewed librarians demonstrated differences in perspective on its purpose.
For example, L1 from a university library claimed: ""We try to stick more to the true purpose of the human library concept as defined by the International Human Library Organization. We're really trying to get people to learn about cultures, backgrounds, and something like that.""
Other participants (L2, L3, L6) all emphasized its potential to dispel stereotypes. As L3 put it: ""To me the human library is a way to bring people together who may not otherwise meet and to also kind of shut down the stereotypes that people have about others and just kind of get people's stories out there.""
L4, a librarian from a small and conservative community, emphasized the knowledge sharing aspect: ""I think [the] human library is good for the community to see [what] other people do. It's a different way of learning. For people to learn about one another. For example, a human book is a cake decorator, so instead of getting a book from the library, they can talk to a human book who has really done it.""
Participants also noted the interactive, conversational aspects of the events. For example, L5 organized human library events both in a community college and within a local community group. She explained that the purpose of the human libraries was ""primarily for a back-and-forth conversation between the human books and the readers.""
L7, the director of a local library resources council who coordinated with the above librarians to organize their events, summarized the purpose of the human library as being: ""to promote understanding and diversity, to fight prejudice and ignorance, and of course to inform.""
The Community and its Needs
According to our interviewed librarians, the implementation of human libraries was closely related to and determined by community characteristics and needs.
For instance, L1 claimed that she had to confine human books to those from within the university: ""We really tried to limit our human books to members of the university community.
We felt like we have so many different people from different backgrounds, different cultures just within our own campus community. We have a lot to offer to each other."" She managed to recruit a Native American student and several other international visitors or students from different countries as books. L5, as a librarian at a community college, also reached out to her campus community, as well as beyond: ""We did a survey of three communication classes to get the topics from the students [their prospective readers]...we also contacted with a local community agency to find topics such as domestic violence or rape victims. We tried to show a wide range of topics.""
L2 also described the importance of the characteristics of the community in which their human library events were located: ""like predominantly white Christian, upper middle class society. Like it's not to say that we don't have minorities...but predominantly white."" Still, it appeared that L2 was open to different topics: ""We try to identify things that are popular and topics that are being discussed currently."" One example was:""We had a trans couple from the high school [as] one of the books. [They're] both trans-gender from males to females, and they're a couple."" Interestingly, L4, serving a conservative community, regarded it as unsuitable to introduce sensitive or controversial human book topics as L2 did in her community, due to her community demographics: ""the people here are very traditional, there are many churches nearby. It's a very conservative community and young people are busy with their work and kids, so it is not appropriate to introduce topics like LGBT. People here tend to like hobby or recreational related topics."" Thus, L4's events focused on different hobbies and many of their readers were seniors who were looking for a hobby to pick up. L7's comments might best summarize issues concerning diversity among libraries and their communities: ""Librarians shared their ideas, what worked in their library, and that benefited everyone. Because we have multiple types of libraries as members, the concerns of all our libraries are different.""
Library Policy
Library policy concerns involve administrative rules and physical space limitations that influence how human library events are realized. In considering potential human books, librarians typically limited consideration to members of their described communities but were also careful to avoid potential conflicts of interest caused by for-profit speakers. L2 described: ""The rules say that we cannot do a program with a for-profit organization...Our branch has that rule against for-profit organizations.""
For organizers interested in recruiting human books on more sensitive topics, library policies often affected the role of the human books. For example, L5 shared with us her policy of handling sensitive topics in her human library events: ""We make sure that for those sensitive topics, like suicide survivors, we have our counselling service sheet and we tell the human books that 'you cannot give advice, as soon as the readers start asking for your advice, you need to give them counselling information.' We have that step ready for each and every sensitive topic.""
The limitations of available physical space are also a consideration when planning a human library event. L6 claimed: ""Our goal really is to be between 8 and 11 because of our space limitations here you want them each to have their own private area so that they're not [disrupted]."" Thus, in organizing human libraries, host libraries were limited by their ability to provide accessible, but still semi-private space.
Human Book Recruitment
A core issue of the human library is how to recruit human books. There is currently no unified system or platform for librarians to use to solicit human books. Interviewees utilized various means and depended largely on their own judgement. There were three major methods that organizers used when recruiting books: recruiting from acquaintances or strangers; using word-of-mouth or computer-supported technology, e.g., social media; and selecting the specific topics.
Recruiting Acquaintances and Strangers
The majority of interviewed librarians preferred to recruit human books from their prior acquaintances. From a university library, L1 explained: ""We used our own personal contacts and we just reached out to people whom we know have interesting stories maybe they were highlighted on campus news because they did something interesting."" She even recruited within her library: ""We also let all the library staff know about that [the human library event]. We send out an announcement to the library staff and we usually get a few library staff members who are willing to participate as human books."" L4, from a small and conservative community, told us her strategy to recruit human books: ""We invite library patrons that came here. We have a lady, she is one of the county legislators, I think people are interested in talking to her..."" L5 also turned to her acquaintances to recruit human books: ""I recruit human books within a walking group formed by our community members, and get to know [the ones] who have some interesting stories to share and want to be human books."" As a librarian working in a community college, L5 also spread the word through their community events: ""Some of our books are also from our faculty members... We would announce our event also in a all-faculty meeting to let all the faculty [members] know and invite the ones who are interested [in being] the human books.""
On the contrary, L3 reached out to people she did not previously know: ""I looked up local authors, I looked up local authors who wrote memoirs... I just called the local fire department and you know, this is what I'm looking for, where do I go and they referred me to the right department and that's pretty much how I found every book, you know, that's here."" L7 posited that the choice between recruiting acquaintances or strangers must be a careful decision. In her mind, it was still a better strategy to recruit known people: ""All [the librarians] have agreed on the need to be careful when recruiting human books. It is best to approach known individuals, people in their community or on their campus. An open call seems dangerous because they then attract those who have an agenda [i.e., those who are profit-seeking].""
Some human books were re-used and shared among different libraries. For example, L2 mentioned: ""My dad was a human book, (and he will be a book) again this year."" L4 told us that their library used to share human books with L2's library: ""We ask the human books in their [L2's] library to also come to our new human library event, to talk about civil war.""
There were cases where the organizers failed to recruit desired books. For example, L3 noted that: ""I tried to reach out to the sheriff's department and I didn't get any response unfortunately. I wanted to have just a police officer, but a different group represented.""
Using Word-of-Mouth or Computer-Supported Technology Word-of-mouth was a common strategy our interviewed librarians used to recruit human books. All of them conversed with potential human books directly or asked their friends and colleagues for input. For example, L6 tried to find representative human books through their library colleagues: ""We ask staff if they know anybody who's interesting, then we go through our files and we look for people.""
Comparatively, the utilization of computer-supported technology such as social media and online forms was not prevalent. L6, a librarian from a middle-and upper-class community library, claimed that she did use social media and primarily Facebook: 
Selecting Book Topics
Selecting human book topics depends to a degree on the resources and interests in a community. For example, L6 claimed: ""We have a variety of topics in different areas and a lot of our speakers, a lot of our books come from people that we meet when we're doing programming here at the library...We try to save, we try to identify things that are popular and topics that are being discussed currently.""
In contrast, L4 made decisions on her own instinct and perception: ""I invite human books who have talent, like cake decorator, gardener, people like butterflies. But like you will meet some gay people, gay couple. But I just don't think that's the theme of our neighborhood, we are more like the butterflies, the cake decorators.""
Librarians might also choose topics according to a vision for the area, or an issue they wish to highlight: ""We try and pick out books that might be stereotyped for one reason or another...I came up with a few [topics] and then kind of word of mouth a little bit...I wanted to come up with a vision and with all the violence in the area, like gun violence on the rise and all that, I wanted to call in some people to talk to that"" (L3).
Again, L5 utilized her community college's courses to let students propose their interested topics: ""Before the human library event every year, we will do a survey in our classes to get the topics, because the students are our major readers. We would go through the most popular topics proposed by our students and think whether we can get such people [human books] that can talk about these topics."" It is noteworthy that except for L5, the other librarians decided the topics primarily by themselves and had little collaboration with the general readers.
Human Book Representation
All participants discussed the process of representing human books with a title and a written description. They all required that title and descriptions should not provide the names of the books or other personally identifying information. The book title and descriptions were made available to readers when selecting a book during the event.
L1 mentioned that building human book profiles was an iterative process: ""Sometimes there is back and forth, so [the human books] try to tweak the description so that it fits or that's getting out of that kind of information that we think is relevant."" Sometimes creating this description could be a challenge: ""I got four pages yesterday from someone of the description of her book. It was like, 'Oh no, I can only take like 4 or 5 sentences.'... It's something that we have to use our judgement...because we really have to look at it, edit it, confirm it and all that stuff.""
L3, oftentimes, had to create human book descriptions, even though she encouraged human books themselves to do so: ""I encourage everyone to write their own title. Regarding the book descriptions, the majority of them [the human books] just asked me to do it. I then let them all know what I came up with and if it is okay.""
Promotion and Reader Recruitment
In parallel with recruitment and representation of human books, another essential step is to attract readers to the human library events. To do this, our interviewed librarians regularly used online methods of promotion, including websites and social media. L1 said: ""Well, the first thing we do is to put together a press release and that goes out on our University News, and that has the link to that form so people can fill that up, i.e. signing up human books."" She also used social media to promote human library events: ""When you create an event on Facebook, you have an option to invite people. You can either invite everybody -all of y",6118,6713

Background: Mental health literacy (MHL) is an evolving concept encompassing knowledge of mental illness, helpseeking options, perceived stigma, and discrimination. This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a human library intervention at enhancing MHL. A human library intervention was adopted to enhance MHL in this study. The human library intervention aims to establish a positive framework and safe space for dialogue between readers and a 'human book' .

The concept of mental health literacy (MHL) has been developed for two decades. It was originally defined as 'the knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which aid their recognition, management or prevention' [1]. It was then further developed and expanded to include knowledge of how to prevent mental disorders, recognition of when a disorder is developing, knowledge of help-seeking options and available treatments, knowledge of effective self-help strategies for milder problems, and first-aid skills to support others who are developing a mental disorder or are in a mental health crisis [2]. However, it mainly promotes intellectual changes that aim to improve the acquisition of knowledge about mental illness. The current conceptualisation of MHL emphasises the importance of attitudes towards people with mental illness and includes reducing stigma and discrimination against them [3]. Perceived stigma and discrimination create intra-personal barriers that affect help-seeking behaviour and intervention efficacy [4]. Improved MHL at both the individual and community levels will improve mental health outcomes, promote early identification, and increase the use of mental health services [3].
Low MHL is associated with a high degree of personal stigma, stigmatising attitudes towards mental disorders, and discrimination towards people with mental disorders [5]. This may eventually discourage people from seeking appropriate diagnostic and intervention procedures to manage their illnesses [6]. MHL is weakly understood in non-Western countries [7]. From a cultural perspective, traditional Chinese values and folk understandings of mental illnesses may be responsible for the low MHL in the Chinese population [8]. There is a strong sense of shame and negative stereotypes about the dangers associated with perceptions of mental illness in Chinese communities [9]. Previous studies have suggested that Chinese people tend to somaticise the symptoms of depression and thus suppress the emotional components of the disorder [10]. Rather than acknowledge the psychological distress associated with a mental disorder, Chinese people tend to express it as a physical symptom. As a result, somatic organ-based language is more frequently used to replace expressions of emotions and psychological problems. The level of MHL, in turn, influences peoples' attitudes towards mental illness [8].
Commonly used intervention strategies for increasing MHL are community campaigns, propaganda, information services, educational talks and mental health first aid training [2,11]. These strategies mostly involve a didactic approach, which aims to provide teaching and information to the target audience to improve their knowledge acquisition in recognizing mental health problems, and teach them how to offer help and support to the people with mental health problems [11]. Most mental health campaigns in Hong Kong are in the early stage of delivery and include only an educational component. They seldom incorporate contact with people who have lived experiences of mental health problems [9]. The human library was, therefore, proposed as an innovative and participatory approach to enhance MHL in this study.
The human library can be used as an innovative method to promote dialogue, reduce prejudice, and encourage understanding of people who are regarded as disadvantaged or in a minority group [12]. The human library aims to establish a positive framework and a safe space for dialogue between readers and a 'human book' . Unlike the didactic teaching approach, it emphasises personal conversation rather than a presentation or lecture to teach knowledge on mental illness. In practice, guests with diverse backgrounds and life experiences are invited to speak to people in the human library session. Common topics discussed with such guests include cultural, religious, social, and ethnic differences. It is not just a presentation of a story, but an engagement and interaction and an exchange from a lived perspective. The human library thus provides a platform for communication between human 'books' and 'readers' with the intent to embrace diversity and equity, promote social inclusion, and reduce stigma [13].
Research evidence on the process and outcomes of human library intervention is limited. However, the impact of the human library intervention on promoting inclusion has been tested in several studies. Orosz et al. [14] tested the effectiveness of a human library intervention at reducing prejudice towards Roma and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. Their results suggested that prejudice towards Roma and LBGT people reduced significantly as a consequence of the human library intervention. Another study examined the effectiveness of a human library intervention at reducing social distance from Roma, Muslim, dark-skinned, and transgender people and homonegativity [15]. Groyecka et al. (2019) found that participating in the human library significantly changed the preferred social distance from Muslims, but did not significantly change homonegativity. These two studies preliminarily confirmed the effectiveness of human library intervention at reducing prejudice. However, both of these experimental studies used only experimental groups and lacked a control or comparison group in their research design, which may decrease the validity of the results.
This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a human library intervention at enhancing MHL. The objectives of the study were as follows:
(1) to test the effectiveness of the human library intervention at increasing overall MHL among young people in Hong Kong;
(2) to test the effectiveness of the human library intervention at improving the knowledge of mental illness among young people in Hong Kong; (3) to test the effectiveness of the human library intervention at reducing stigmatisation of mental illness among young people in Hong Kong; and (4) to test the effectiveness of the human library intervention at reducing the preferred social distance from people with mental illness among young people in Hong Kong, as compared to a didactic educational approach and a control group.
Methods

Research design and procedures
This study adopted an experimental approach to test the effectiveness of a human library intervention at increasing MHL. A multigroup pretest-posttest control group design was used. Such a design allows for a comparison of intervention effects between different intervention and control conditions [16]. Participants were randomly assigned to each of the following three groups: (1) the experimental group, in which the participants engaged in the human library intervention; (2) a comparison group, in which the participants engaged in a didactic educational session; and (3) a control group, in which the participants received no intervention. The interventions were conducted separately and transfer between groups was not allowed. Pretests and posttests were performed for all participants in all three groups to determine the level of MHL before and after the intervention session.
The pretest was conducted before the day of intervention, while the posttest was performed one hour after the intervention program.
Participants
Forty-five young adults were openly recruited from local tertiary educational institutions for participation in this study. Upon enrolment, participants were screened for eligibility using the following inclusion criteria: (1) they were young adults attending a local tertiary educational institution, and (2) they were mentally stable and able to comprehend the instructions in the assessment and training. Participants were excluded if they, or their close relatives, had been diagnosed with a mental illness. Cohen defined an effect size of more than 0.5 is considered to be clinically significant [17]. Our design provided adequate statistical power, with a sample size of 45. Using G*Power 3.0.10, an actual power of 0.9 was calculated, with an effect size of 0.6. The effect size was medium to large [17], with the level of significance set at 0.05. Ethical approval was granted by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University. Informed consent was obtained from all participants before their participation in the study. No remuneration was provided for participants in this study.
Outcome measures
A modified version of the vignette-based MHL scale [18] was used in this study. The scale was adapted based on recent relevant evidence [10,18,19] and comprised three MHL subscales: (1) knowledge, which included a recognition of mental disorders and knowledge of helpseeking options [18]; (2) perceived stigma [10]; and (3) discrimination, which included preferred social distance [19]. There were 51 items in the vignette-based MHL scale, with 12 items in the knowledge domain, 24 items in the stigma domain, and 15 items in the discrimination domain (Table 1). Three sets of vignettes describing the major types of common mental health conditions (i.e. schizophrenia, affective disorder, and generalised anxiety disorder) were used in the questionnaire. Each set comprised two vignettes of the same mental disorder, one set was use in the pretest while the other set was used in the posttest. A vignette is a case scenario that describes the situation of an individual with a mental disorder. It is commonly used in testing MHL [2]. A high total score denotes a high MHL and vice versa. The reliability of the overall scale and the three subscales for the current sample set was confirmed (Table 1). Cronbach's alpha of the overall scale in pretest was 0.81 and posttest was 0.90, which indicated a good internal consistency [16]. 
Interventions
The human library intervention was a one-off activity. The programme lasted for 2 hours and took place at a student development centre. There were two human books (people who shared their stories): a woman with schizophrenia and a man with bipolar disorder. At the beginning, a trained instructor introduced the rules for the activity, such as mutual respect, confidentiality, and genuineness. Readers had to be respectful in their questions and conversation with the Human Book and other Readers. Fifteen participants were then divided into two groups to take turns to read the books. Each group went to a room that had a comfortable setting, where everyone could sit freely and feel relaxed. This provided a safe space for communication with minimal pressure. Readers were briefed with the guidelines in attending the human library. When reading, the books first shared their story, including details on how they were diagnosed, their rehabilitation experience in hospital, how they see their illness, how they were supported, and the obstacles encountered when re-entering society. After the books finished sharing, the participants were free to ask questions. The questions were about how to support people with mental disorders and how to help reduce public stigma. At the end of the reading session, the participants wrote feedback for the books, such as messages of appreciation and encouragement. The didactic educational programme involved a oneoff teaching session that lasted 2 hours. In the session, a trained instructor used a comprehensive PowerPoint slideshow to teach the participants about common mental disorders. The session covered a basic understanding of mental illness, including its aetiology, signs and symptoms, common interventions, and available services. Recent statistics and mental health needs of the local community were also included in the training session to enable a comprehensive understanding of common mental disorders.
For participants in the control group, there was no intervention provided throughout the course of the programme.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to illustrate the profile of MHL in the three groups according to the sub-domains and the three mental health conditions. To test the effectiveness of the human library intervention at improving MHL, a one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare the dependent variable, which was the overall MHL, in the three groups with the pretest score of the control group. To test the effect of the human library intervention on knowledge, perceived stigma, and social distance, a one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to account for the relationships among the three dependent variables (knowledge, stigma, and social distance) when comparing the three groups. To test the effect of the human library intervention on overall MHL, a MANOVA was used to determine if there were any differences between the three groups in the overall MHL related to schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorder in both the pretest and posttest.
Results
The study included 45 participants, of which 14 were male and 31 were female. Their ages ranged from 19 to 23 years (mean = 21.3, standard deviation = 0.65). All participants were attending tertiary institutions. Descriptive statistics showing the profile of the three groups are provided in Table 2.
Intervention effects -overall MHL
The primary outcome measure was overall MHL. A one-way ANCOVA was performed to compare the between the groups. Post hoc tests showed a significant difference between the experimental and comparison groups (p = 0.001), and between the experimental and control groups (p = 0.003). However, there was no significant difference between the comparison and control groups (p = 1.00). On comparing the estimated marginal means, the highest MHL was found in the experimental group (M = 141.56) compared with the comparison (M = 121.91) and control groups (M = 123.41).
Intervention effects -knowledge, stigma, and social distance
The three subscales reflected three essential aspects of MHL, namely, knowledge, stigma, and social distance.
A one-way MANOVA was used to determine whether there were any differences between the three groups in term of the three subscale scores in the pretest and posttest. The MANOVA indicated no significant differences between the groups for knowledge, stigma, or social distance scores (F [6, 80] = 0.73, p = 0.631) in the pretest. In the MANOVA for posttest scores, there was a statistically significant difference in subscale scores between the three groups (F [6, 80] = 4.16, p = 0.001; Wilk's Λ = 0.58; partial η 2 = 0.24). Significant differences were found in the stigma subscale score (F [2, 42] = 3.27, p = 0.04, effect size d = 0.79) and the social distance subscale score (F [2, 42] = 14.21, p = 0.000, effect size d = 1.64). However, no significant difference was found in the knowledge subscale score (F [2, 42] = 1.349, p = 0.27). Post hoc univariate tests revealed the source of the significant main effects. Significant differences were found in the social distance score between the experimental group and both the control and comparison groups (p < 0.01); and in the stigma score between the experimental and control groups (p < 0.05).
Intervention effects -MHL for schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorder
Three sets of vignettes measured the participants' MHL for schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorder. A MANOVA was used to determine if there were any differences between the three groups in the MHL for the three mental health conditions in the pretest and posttest. No significance differences were found between the groups for MHL scores for schizophrenia, depression, or anxiety disorder in the pretest (F [6, 80] = 0.34, p = 0.91).
In the MANOVA of the posttest scores, there was a statistically significant difference in the dependent variables Post hoc univariate tests revealed the source of significant main effects. Significant differences in MHL for schizophrenia (p < 0.05) and depression (p < 0.01) were found between the experimental group and both the control and comparison groups. For MHL regarding anxiety disorder, a significant difference was only found between the experimental and control groups (p < 0.01).
Discussion
This study demonstrated that the human library intervention significantly improved overall MHL, as compared with didactic teaching (comparison group) or no intervention (control group). In the human library intervention, the participants were able to immediately ask questions to clarify their misunderstandings, and thus, they gained a better understanding of the person (human book) and their disabilities. Face-to-face encounters of the participants with people with mental illness literally narrowed the social distance by placing them together in a real-life situation. Contact is essential to decrease prejudice. Intergroup contact theory suggests that contact, under certain optimal conditions, decreases prejudice and discrimination [20]. A human library provides an opportunity for intergroup contact under such optimal conditions, as there is equal status between the person with the mental illness and the audience; common goals of enhancing communication and reducing prejudice are shared during the session; and intergroup cooperation is encouraged. According to Fisher's narrative paradigm theory, all meaningful human communication can be viewed as narration and can be effective when people see good reasons for adopting the point of view advocated in the communication [21]. The lived experience, as communicated through the human library session, may change people's attitudes because the stories and experiences shared are all true and authentic. This promotes respect, acceptance, and mutual understanding towards both the person and the disabilities. MHL in this study was conceptualised as a construct comprised of three domains: knowledge of mental illness, stigmatisation towards mental illness, and the maintenance of a preferred social distance from people with mental illness. The MANOVA results showed that the human library was effective at reducing stigma and social distance, but did not affect knowledge acquisition. This study confirmed previous data showing that human library intervention promotes inclusion by reducing stigma and social distance [14,15]. However, the results of this study showed that participants in neither of the three groups demonstrated a significant improvement in the acquisition of knowledge about mental health. This result may imply that a single, stand-alone mental health information session, or even a human library session, is not sufficient to promote a significant intellectual change. To enhance effectiveness, information and awarenessraising sessions may need to be incorporated in a curriculum, rather than conducting them as one-off sessions, and the consumer-educator (i.e. the person with mental health issues) may need to be involved in the training activities [11].
This study demonstrated that the didactic teaching approach was not effective at enhancing MHL. MHL involves more than health education [22]. The didactic teaching approach (comparison group) had limited effects because it may have overloaded the participants with information. Because of the limitations and restrictions in processing capacity in such a relatively brief training session, participants in a 1-hour-long session can only be presented with a limited amount of information, and even less of this information is then encoded and learnt [23]. Moreover, solely providing knowledge, without contact, is not sufficient to improve the essential components of MHL, such as help seeking and reducing stigma and discrimination [20]. These findings echoed those of a previous study, in which lecture-based teaching on MHL did not significantly improve attitudes (stigma) or behaviours (discrimination) towards mental illness [24].
This study also assessed the level of MHL among the three groups using three sets of vignettes to illustrate the three mental health conditions (schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorder). The human library intervention was found to be significantly effective at increasing MHL for schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorder. It is worth noting that in the human library session, two guests (human books) were included: one with schizophrenia and the other with depression. As such, anxiety disorder was not formally introduced in the human library session. The improvement in the MHL scores in all three conditions may imply that the human library did have a generalised effect on reducing stigma and social distance and increasing the understanding of help seeking.
MHL is an evolving construct that includes an understanding of mental disorders and help-seeking options (knowledge) and decreasing stigma (attitudes) and social distance (behaviour). To enhance the effectiveness of the human library intervention at improving MHL, all three components (knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours) of MHL should be addressed in a balanced manner. There is currently no standardised protocol for human library intervention. It is not feasible or practical to have a standardised protocol for a human library, because it emphasises the sharing of unique and personal experiences. However, it is recommended that the planning of the human library session should follow a gross framework to include all three components: knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours. To enhance knowledge acquisition, it may be necessary to include some educational materials to enable the participants to learn and understand the specific types of disabilities. To address the issues of stigma and discrimination, it is necessary to focus on the impact of the disability on activities and social participation in relation to social and cultural contexts. The adoption of a community-based inclusive development model is preferred rather than a medical-oriented and impairment-based model. Unlike the medical approach, which has a narrow focus on the signs and symptoms of an illness, a community-based inclusive development model emphasises the rights of people with disabilities to participate equally in the community [25].
Strengths and limitations of this study were explored. This study contributes to the evidence-based practice of human library and MHL interventions. It is pioneer research in Chinese communities examining the impact of a human library intervention on participants. It followed the recent trends and latest conceptualisations of MHL by including the domains of acquisition of mental health knowledge, stigma, and preferred social distance in the process. A homogeneous group of participants (i.e. young adults attending tertiary education institutes) was targeted, and this enabled a valid comparison between the experimental, comparison, and control groups. This study has some limitations. This study involved more females than males and it might affect the generalizability of study results. Although a power analysis demonstrated that the sample size of this study (n = 45) achieved sufficient power, its validity may have been enhanced if the sample size was increased. This study adapted the MHL scale as an outcome measure. Further development and testing of this adapted scale are warranted to enhance its validity and reliability. Moreover, the concept of MHL and the validity of the construct are evolving and should be further confirmed and clarified to ensure the validity of the various testing methods.
Future research development into this area is indicated. To further test the efficacy of the intervention, it may also be necessary to examine the maintenance of the intervention effect after terminating the intervention. Follow-up assessments to test for the sustained effectiveness of stigma reduction intervention is deemed essential [26]. Moreover, a qualitative approach can be adopted to enhance the understanding of human library intervention. A quantitative approach could capture mainly the quantitative change of the participants upon the intervention. Important qualitative change of the participants and the human library process itself was not captured in this study. It may be interested to look into the interaction between the participants (readers) and the human books in using a qualitative approach. Using a qualitative approach, it will be able to capture also the qualitative change in awareness, thoughts and behaviours as a result of the intervention to improve MHL. Such qualitative outcomes might include a change in interaction pattern with the people with mental health issues, increased altruistic behaviour towards those in need or made donations to mental health charities.
Conclusions
This study confirmed the effectiveness of a human library intervention at improving MHL. The human library intervention specifically reduced the stigma towards and perceived social distance from people with mental illness. As an innovative form of intervention to enhance MHL, it is suggested that the planning of the programme adhere to the overall goals of improving the acquisition of knowledge about mental illness and reducing stigma and social distance. Further studies are recommended to further develop the content of the human library intervention and to validate the constructs and related measurements of MHL.",4748,5200
10.1111/jasp.12379,,Orosz et al 2016 ,True,Gábor Orosz,Don't judge a living book by its cover: effectiveness of the living library intervention in reducing prejudice toward Roma and LGBT people,"
In Hungary, prejudices toward Roma and the LGBT community are highly salient and explicit in public opinion, the media, and in the political discourse. The present study examined the effectiveness of the Living Library prejudice reduction intervention-in which participants as ""Readers"" have engaging contact with living ""Books"" who are trained volunteers from the Roma and LGBT communities. In a pre-post intervention study with high school students (N 5 105), results suggest that the Living Library intervention reduced participants' scores on multiple measures of prejudice. The Living Library intervention appeared to be effective among both those participants whose friends endorsed prejudice or more tolerant attitudes toward Roma and LGBT people. In sum, Living Library appears to be a useful method for reducing prejudice in contexts which are characterized by strong negative attitudes toward these different groups.
",2016-03-20,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,Wiley,"Introduction
Prejudices toward Roma and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people are highly salient in Hungary. According to a nationally representative study, 60% of Hungarians believe that ""The inclination toward criminality is in the blood of gypsies"" and 42% agreed that ""It is only right that there are still bars, clubs, and discos where gypsies are not let in"" (Bern at, Juh asz, Krek o, & Moln ar, 2013). Similarly, national surveys of Hungarians indicate that only 45% agree that ""gay men and lesbians should be free to live their own lives as they wish"" (Lipka, 2013) and one fifth of Hungarians believe that ""homosexuality is a sin against God or society"" (Tak acs, 2011).
Anti-Roma and anti-gay prejudice are further reinforced through prevailing norms expressed through social and political discourse (Bern ath & Messing, 2013). For example, a well-known journalist and co-founder of the ruling right wing party (Fidesz) has stated that ""A significant portion of the Gypsies are unfit for co-existence, not fit to live among human beings. . . these people are animals and behave like animals. . ."" (European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, 2015). As reported in a respected Hungarian political journal, another right wing politician indicated that he would punish homosexual people with ""several years of imprisonment, fines or seclusion"" (hvg.hu, 2012).
A number of methods have been proposed to reduce prejudice, including several based in learning about others through intergroup contact, exposure to media (e.g., stories, books, radio), and reflections on peer influence (Paluck & Green, 2009). Many efforts have been made to reduce prejudice against Roma and LGBT people in Hungary, among them the Living Library program; this program is supported by the European Youth Centre Budapest under the umbrella of the Council of Europe. The goal of the Living Library is to challenge prejudice by facilitating a conversation (""Reading"") between volunteers and participants who are assigned different roles: as ""Books"" or as ""Readers"", respectively. The Living ""Books"" are volunteers who have suffered from discrimination, stigma or prejudice due to their group membership, and who are willing to share personal experiences of social exclusion with ""Readers"". In the Living Library program, ""Books"" give ""Readers"" permission to ask questions and enter into dialogue with them, which can enhance learning and challenge commonly held perceptions of and attitudes toward targeted groups. In the present study, we sought to assess the effectiveness of the Living Library approach, as it provides opportunities for people to have close contact with Roma and LGBT people and to learn from the personal stories they share.
Decades of theory and research support the notion that contact between members of different groups can be a useful strategy for reducing intergroup prejudice (Allport, 1954;Brown & Hewstone, 2005;Pettigrew, 1998;Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). A recent meta-analysis also shows that contactbased interventions are generally effective in reducing prejudice and tensions between societal groups; contact-based interventions lead not only to more positive attitudes toward the individual outgroup members with whom one had contact, but they generalize to more positive attitudes toward the outgroup as a whole (Lemmer & Wagner, 2015). Contact is especially likely to reduce prejudice when the different groups interact cooperatively with support of institutional norms and authorities (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), such that people are able to build affective ties across group lines as they learn more about each other (Pettigrew, 1998;Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008).
Living Library accomplishes these goals by providing opportunities for ""Readers"" to interact cooperatively with ""Books"" through a program structured to support their interaction, during which ""Readers"" can learn about and connect with ""Books"" who share their personal experiences.Thus, based in models that employ intergroup contact as an effective tool for prejudice reduction (Brown & Hewstone, 2005;Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), the Living Library intervention was designed to facilitate interaction between ""Readers"" and ""Books"" in ways that that make conversation meaningful and engaging between groups (Little, Nemutlu, Magic, & Moln ar, 2011).
At the same time, the Living Library intervention is distinct from other kinds of contact situations in which members of different groups are merely brought together to interact with each other. First, ""Books"" are trained volunteers who have amassed a great deal of prior contact experience and are prepared to respond to questions that may be regarded as potentially aggressive or highly sensitive. Second, ""Readers"" are asked to prepare for these contact situations by reflecting on what they wish to learn and developing sets of questions to be presented to the ""Books"" during their interaction; these questions are collected in advance and asked of the ""Books"" without attribution to specific ""Readers"" to facilitate meaningful conversation while easing anxiety among ""Reader"" participants. Third, as representatives of their groups, ""Books"" can share their personal stories and experiences with ""Readers"" in ways that both enhance intimacy and maintain the salience of group boundaries (Brown & Hewstone, 2005).
Due to this structured contact between ""Readers"" and ""Books,"" we anticipate that Living Library can be an effective way to reduce ""Reader"" prejudices toward Roma and LGBT people. Although the framework of Living Library has been used with thousands of individuals in more than 60 countries (Little et al., 2011), no prior quantitative study has examined the effectiveness of the Living Library prejudice reduction interventions. Therefore, a primary goal of the present research was to test the effectiveness of the Living Library approach as a strategy to reduce prejudice toward Roma and LGBT people. Compared to scores before the intervention, we expected that participants who interacted with a Roma ""Book"" would report lower levels of prejudice toward Roma people more generally following the interaction; similarly, we expected that participants who interacted with an LGBT ""Book"" would report lower levels of prejudice toward LGBT people more generally following the interaction.
Additionally, to our knowledge, there have been no prior quantitative studies in Hungary that test the effectiveness of prejudice reduction interventions toward such explicitly stigmatized groups as Roma and LGBT people. Thus, beyond testing its general effectiveness, we also examined the effectiveness of the Living Library intervention in relation to the degree to which participants perceived higher or lower levels of anti-Roma and anti-LGBT prejudice in their social environments. Specifically, we examine the effectiveness of the Living Library program among participants whose friends are perceived to endorse more prejudice toward Roma and LGBT people (more prejudicial peers) versus those participants who see their friends as more tolerant toward these groups (less prejudicial peers). Social relationships are important in the formation of attitudes, as ingroup peers can have a significant influence on the attitudes of fellow ingroup members (Smith & Louis, 2008). Particularly among adolescents, peer influences are highly important in relation to prejudice (e.g., Birkett & Espelage, 2015;Poteat, 2007;V aradi, 2014), yet little is known regarding the extent to which peer prejudices might undermine the effectiveness of prejudice reduction interventions. This study addresses this issue by examining whether perceiving prejudiced attitudes among one's peers inhibits the effectiveness of the Living Library program. In sum, with a sample of Hungarian adolescents, the present research assesses the effectiveness of the Living Library intervention and tests whether and how perceived peer prejudices moderate its effectiveness in reducing prejudice toward Roma and LGBT people.
Method
Participants and procedure A total of 105 Hungarian public high school students (46 female, 43.8%) participated in this study in spring 2013. These students were recruited from seven high schools and were between the ages of 14 and 20 (M age 5 16.87; SD age 5 .92). To ensure the ethical treatment of human participants, this study was carried out with the approval of the local university's ethical board. Participation in this study was entirely voluntary, and the consent of both students and parents were obtained in advance of participation. None of the participants had heard about the Living Library program before participation in the study. Of the 115 students who were approached about participating in the study, 111 chose to participate and among them 105 completed both the preand post-test measures.
Three to five days before any contact experiences, the student participants completed measures of prejudice toward Roma and LGBT people; then, following the guidelines of the Living Library program, students participated in a conversation with the intervention leader to clarify terminology associated with prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination, and to review some case examples, after which they began to choose topics and draft questions in preparation for contact sessions with ""Books"" during the following week.
Students were informed that they could select a stigmatized community on which to focus for their contact sessions, and then small groups of 2-3 students were matched with a ""Book"" from that community for a 20-minute conversation. The first two sets of ""Books"" included representatives from our primary target groups (Roma and LGBT); a third set of ""Books"" included representatives from a comparison ""control"" group (Homeless). Altogether, 30 students selected only one ""Book,"" 46 students selected two ""Books,"" and 29 students selected all three ""Books."" Of these students, 42 had contact with both Roma and LGBT ""Books."" The ""Books"" were adults aged between 30 and 55 years old who had received training and who had experience with student ""Readers"" through the Living Library program for at least one year.
Students could ask ""Books"" whatever questions they wished, and through responding to questions, the ""Books"" were able to share their stories and experiences of prejudice, discrimination, and social exclusion. Immediately after the conversation, participants again filled out the prejudice measures in relation to Roma and LGBT people. On the pre-and post-intervention surveys, participants were also asked to provide a unique code word to identify their responses, so that scores on the pre-and post-contact surveys could be compared while maintaining anonymity of the respondents.
Measures
Measures of social distance and modern racism were translated into Hungarian from the original scales (Beaton et al., 2000), modified to be used in relation to Roma and LGBT people, and these were presented to participants in a randomized order. In addition, a measure of perceived peer norms concerning prejudice toward Roma and LGBT people was also included in the surveys distributed to participants.
Social distance
We adapted a shortened, four-item scale (Bogardus, 1933;Norman, Sorrentino, Windell, & Manchanda, 2008) to assess the degree to which respondents would be willing to accept and engage in contact with a member of each outgroup (e.g., Roma, LGBT) across several domains, including as a desk mate at school, as a friend, as a neighbor, and as a relative. This scale had good internal consistencies concerning both Roma (a pre 5 .84; a post 5 .93) and LGBT (a pre 5 .90; a post 5 .94) groups. Higher scores on this scale indicate larger social distance between the individual and the members of the outgroup.
Modern racism
We used an adapted, six-item version of the Modern Racism Scale (McConahay, 1986) to assess prejudiced attitudes toward Roma and LGBT people (e.g., ""Over the past few years, [Gypsies/Homosexuals] have gotten more economically than they deserve""). Respondents indicated their level of agreement using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree), with higher scores indicating higher levels of prejudice. This scale had good internal consistencies concerning both Roma (a pre 5 .77; a post 5 .81) and LGBT (a pre 5 .79; a post 5 .85) groups.
Perceived peer prejudice
In addition, we adapted the same sets of four items used to estimate participants' social distance scores, in order to ask participants about the extent to which they perceived that their friends would be willing to accept and engage in contact with Roma and LGBT people across domains (as a desk mate at school, as a friend, as a neighbor, and as a relative). Responses to these items ranged from 1 (They certainly would not) to 5 (They certainly would), such that higher scores corresponded with lower perceptions of prejudiced norms among their friends. This scale had good internal consistencies concerning both Roma (a pre 5 .92; a post 5 .96) and LGBT (a pre 5 .95; a post 5 .97) groups.
Results
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22. Means and standard deviations for the prejudice measures among participants who did or did not have contact with Roma and
LGBT ""Books"" are provided in Table 1. To test our hypothesis that the Living Library intervention would change prejudiced attitudes, we performed 2 3 2 mixed model analyses of variance (ANOVA) with CONTACT (had contact or did not have contact with a member of the group) as a between-subjects factor, and TIME (pre-intervention and post-intervention) as a within-subjects factor.
First, we tested whether the Living Library intervention changed attitudes toward Roma people, by conducting prepost comparisons on each prejudice measure (social distance, modern prejudice) among participants who did or did not have contact with Roma ""Books."" Second, we tested whether the Living Library intervention changed attitudes toward LGBT people by conducting pre-post comparisons on each prejudice measure (social distance, modern prejudice) among participants who did or did not have contact with
LGBT ""Books."" Finally, we tested whether participants' normative perceptions of anti-Roma or anti-LGBT prejudice among their friends moderated the effectiveness of the Living Library interventions.
Effectiveness of living library Roma intervention
The CONTACT 3 TIME ANOVA predicting social distance did not reveal significant main effects of TIME, F(1, 103) 5 3.14, p 5 .079, g 2 p 5 .03, power 5 .42; or CONTACT, F(1, 103) 5 3.32, p 5 .071, g 2 p 5 .03, power 5 .44. However, the interaction of CONTACT 3 TIME was significant, F(1, 103) 5 26.85, p < .001, g 2 p 5 .21, power 5 1. Although social distance scores did not significantly differ between the Roma contact and no-Roma contact groups at baseline (p 5 .81), social distance decreased significantly from pre-test to posttest among participants who had contact with a Roma ""Book"" as compared to those who did not have contact with a Roma ""Book"" (Figure 1a). Pairwise comparisons revealed that participants who had contact with a Roma ""Book"" reported significantly lower social distance over time (p < .021), while those in the no-Roma contact group showed significantly greater social distance over time (p < .001). 1  The CONTACT 3 TIME ANOVA predicting modern racism revealed a significant main effect of TIME, F(1, 103) 5 11.77, p < .001, g 2 p 5 .10, power 5 .93; but not in the case of CONTACT, F(1, 103) 5 1.17, p 5 .282, g 2 p 5 .01, power 5 .18, and a significant CONTACT 3 TIME interaction, F(1, 103) 5 12.16, p < .001, g 2 p 5 .11, power 5 .93. Although modern racism scores did not significantly differ between the Roma contact and no-Roma contact groups at baseline (p 5 .56), modern racism decreased significantly from pre-test to posttest among participants who had contact with a Roma ""Book"" as compared to those who did not have contact with a Roma ""Book"" (Figure 1b). Pairwise comparisons revealed that participants who had contact with a Roma ""Book"" reported significantly lower modern racism over time (p < .001), while those in the no-Roma contact group did not significantly in modern racism scores over time (p 5 .972). 2
Effectiveness of living library LGBT intervention
The CONTACT 3 TIME ANOVA predicting social distance revealed significant main effects of TIME, F(1, 103) 5 12.12, p 5 .001, g 2 p 5 .11, power 5 .93, and CONTACT, F(1, 103) 5 6.13, p 5 .015, g 2 p 5 .06, power 5 .69. The interaction of CONTACT 3 TIME was also significant, F(1, 103) 5 56.04, p < .001, g 2 p 5 .35, power 5 1. Although social distance scores did not significantly differ between the LGBT contact and no-LGBT contact groups at baseline (p 5 .63), social distance decreased significantly from pre-test to post-test The baseline social distance of the contact vs. no contact groups were not different (p 5 .811), but the post test scores differed from each other (p 5 .002) (Figure 1a)
The baseline MRS scores of the contact vs. no contact groups were not different (p 5 .557), but the post-test MRS scores were significantly different (p 5 .011) (Figure 1b)
among participants who had contact with an LGBT ""Book"" as compared to those who did not have contact with an
LGBT ""Book"" (Figure 1c). Pairwise comparisons revealed that participants who had contact with an LGBT ""Book"" reported significantly lower social distance over time (p < .002), while those in the no-LGBT contact group showed significantly greater social distance over time (p < .001). 3  The CONTACT 3 TIME ANOVA predicting modern racism revealed no significant main effect of TIME, F(1, 103) 5 1.10, p 5 .296, g 2 p g 2 p 5 .00, power 5 .18; but there was a significant main effect in the case of CONTACT, F(1, 103) 5 5.86, p 5 .017, g 2 p 5 .05, power 5 .67. The interaction of CONTACT 3 TIME was also significant, F(1, 103) 5 8.86, p 5 .004, g 2 p 5 .08, power 5 .84, Although modern racism scores did not significantly differ between the LGBT contact and no-LGBT contact groups at baseline (p 5 .31), modern racism decreased significantly from pre-test to post-test among participants who had contact with an LGBT ""Book"" as compared to those who did not have contact with an LGBT ""Book"" (Figure 1d). Pairwise comparisons revealed that participants who had contact with an LGBT ""Book"" reported significantly lower modern racism over time (p < .05), while those in the no-LGBT contact group tended to report greater modern racism over time (p 5 .06), 4 however, this difference was not significant at the .05 level of significance.
Perceived peer prejudice as a moderator of living library effects
Finally, we examined whether participants' perceptions of prejudice toward Roma and LGBT people would moderate the effectiveness of the Living Library interventions.  The baseline social distance scores of the contact vs. no contact groups were not different (p 5 .631), but they were different in the post-test (p < .001) (Figure 1c) 4 Modern racism scores of the contact and no contact groups were not significantly different at pre-test (p 5 .309), however, modern racism scores were significantly different between these groups at post-test (p 5 .001) (see Figure 1d).
Perceived peer prejudice toward Roma
Based on social distance scores measuring perceived peers' attitudes toward Roma (M 5 12.47; SD 5 3.41; a 5 .82), the sample was split into two groups (median split) to distinguish between participants who perceived lower prejudice toward Roma among their peers (M 12) and those who perceived higher prejudice toward Roma among their peers (M > 12). We then conducted a 2 (CONTACT) 3 2 (TIME) 3 2 (PEER PREJUDICE: High/Low) ANOVA to predict participants' own social distance scores in relation to Roma people.
Beyond the effects for CONTACT and TIME reported above, this analysis revealed only a significant main effect for PEER PREJUDICE, F(1, 101) 5 47.96, p < .001, such that participants' Roma social distance scores were higher among those who perceived greater prejudice toward Roma among their peers (Figure 2a). PEER PREJUDICE did not significantly interact with either CONTACT, F(1, 101) 5 .01, p 5 .94, or TIME, F(1, 101) 5 .38, p 5 .55, and the three-way interaction between CONTACT, TIME, and PEER PREJU-DICE was also not significant, F(1, 101) 5 1.04, p 5 .31. These results indicate that the Living Library Intervention can be similarly effective regardless of the extent to which participants perceived prejudice toward Roma among their peers.
Perceived peer prejudice toward LGBT
Using social distance scores measuring perceived peer attitudes toward LGBT people (M 5 11.69; SD 5 3.69; a 5 .89), the sample was once again split into two groups (median split) to distinguish between participants who perceived lower prejudice toward LGBT people among their peers (M 12) and those who perceived higher prejudice toward LGBT people among their peers (M > 12). We then conducted a 2 (CONTACT) 3 2 (TIME) 3 2 (PEER PREJU-DICE: High/Low) ANOVA to predict participants' own social distance scores in relation to LGBT people.
Beyond the effects of CONTACT and TIME reported above, this analysis revealed only a significant main effect for PEER PREJUDICE, F(1, 101) 5 42.04, p < .001, such that participants' LGBT social distance scores were higher among those who perceived greater prejudice toward LGBT people among their peers (Figure 2b). PEER PREJUDICE did not significantly interact with either CONTACT, F(1, 101) 5 1.51, p 5 .22, or TIME, F(1, 101) 5 .25, p 5 .62, and the three-way interaction between CONTACT, TIME, and PEER PREJUDICE was also not significant, F(1, 101) 5 0.74, p 5 .39. These results indicate that the Living Library Intervention can be similarly effective regardless of the extent to which participants perceived prejudice toward LGBT people among their peers. 
Discussion
The goal of the present study was to measure the effectiveness of the Living Library reducing prejudice toward Roma and LGBT people in the Hungarian context, where these groups are subject to highly salient and explicit forms of prejudice and discrimination. The results suggest that prejudice toward Roma and LGBT people decreases significantly as a consequence of the intergroup contact participants experienced through the Living Library intervention. We consistently observed lower levels of prejudice on two separate prejudice measures (social distance, modern racism) and in relation to two distinct target groups. As such, it appears that Living Library is an effective method for reducing prejudice toward targeted groups such as the Roma and LGBT communities in Hungary.
Here, it is particularly important to highlight how the Hungarian societal context is quite distinct from contexts such as the United States that largely endorse norms of tolerance following extensive movements in support of civil rights (see Aronson, Blaney, Stephan, Sikes, & Snapp, 1978;Fiske, 2000;Pettigrew, Tropp, Wagner, & Christ, 2011). In Hungary, the media, politicians, and the general public explicitly express prejudice toward Roma people (Bern at et al., 2013;Bern ath & Messing, 2013) and LGBT people (Tak acs, 2011), and it is necessary to employ strategies and interventions that can counter this prevailing societal narrative. Results from this research suggest that the Living Library intervention can serve as a useful weapon in this fight. Moreover, the present findings indicate that it might be fruitful to examine the effectiveness of the Living Library approach with a broader array of groups both within and beyond the Hungarian context.
While the Living Library intervention produced lower prejudice scores at post-test for both prejudice measures, close inspection of the effect sizes reveals that the intervention had a somewhat stronger impact on social distance scores (reflecting a willingness to engage in close contact with the outgroup) than on modern racism scores (concerning societal beliefs about the outgroup). These patterns of results are consistent with the Living Library focus on sharing personal stories, which are likely to elicit greater feelings of intergroup closeness and intimacy; these results are also consistent with other work showing that contact typically yields stronger effects on more affectively-based dimensions of prejudice as compared to its effects on cognitively-based dimensions of prejudice (see Tropp & Pettigrew, 2005). Further studies might examine whether similar patterns of results might be observed with other prejudice measures, including implicit measures which have been associated with positive contact effects in prior research (e.g., Aberson, Shoemaker, & Tomolillo, 2004).
Importantly, we also observed that perceived prejudice of one's peers did not fundamentally alter the effectiveness of the Living Library intervention. Although peers can play an important role in the development of prejudicial attitudes (Poteat, 2007;Smith & Louis, 2008;V aradi, 2014), and participants who perceived higher levels of peer prejudice showed higher mean prejudice scores themselves, peer prejudice had little influence on the effectiveness of Roma and LGBT prejudice reduction interventions. These results have important implications for fostering prejudice reduction in contexts where prejudices toward targeted groups are widespread and consensual. Further research in needed to test the effectiveness of the Living Library approach in relation to other broad-scale social influences, such as in relation to attitudes expressed through media and community leaders, alongside the potential influence of prejudice among one's peers.
While our findings offer clear support for contact-based interventions such as the Living Library program, we must acknowledge some limitations associated with the research.
Our study only assessed pre-and post-intervention responses from participants, as we were only able to include a comparison group in our research design rather than a true control group. We also did not randomly assign participants to different experimental conditions. We did not pursue random assignment in the present study because (a) we wished to replicate the procedures typically used in the Living Library program, in order to test its effectiveness; and (b) we wished to allow participants to have the opportunity to interact with ""Books"" from more than one outgroup in the event that they chose to do so. Even without random assignment, we observe no significant differences in prejudice scores toward Roma or LGBT people among those who did or did not choose to interact with ""Books"" from these groups, suggesting that the positive contact effects we observed cannot be attributed to initial differences in prejudice. Still, future studies should test the effects of the Living Library with random assignment of participants to different experimental conditions, to test whether assigning participants to interact with ""Books"" from different groups may yield even larger contact effects, as other experimental studies have shown (see Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Additionally, future studies should include more assessments of prejudice reduction following the contact intervention, to examine the potential long-term effects of the Living Library program. Nonetheless, despite these methodological limitations, the present research shows the Living Library program to be an effective contact-based intervention for combating prejudice against Roma and LGBT people in a societal context where prejudices against these groups is salient and explicit in the public discourse.",5903,6683

What is a Human Library?
The Human Library (formerly Living Library) is an initiative whereby people who have experienced prejudice or stereotyping in life become ""Human Books"" and are taken out for coffee and conversation by ""Readers"". The conversations create learning opportunities rarely otherwise found. The Human Books tell their story and then receive questions from participating Readers. Putting a human face to prejudice and stereotypes challenges people to think differently and to support and advocate more accepting and supportive environments for all. Offerings of Human Libraries are becoming more frequent in academic libraries. Human Libraries were first established at folk festivals in Denmark by youth seeking to raise awareness of violence. An overview and history of the Human Library movement and associated documents can be found at the Human Library Organization's webpage at humanlibrary.org.
The augustana human library
The augustana human library brings to the Augustana Campus (Camrose, AB, Canada) of the University of Alberta an opportunity to discuss prejudice and stereotypes with the persons who have been recipients of prejudice and stereotypes. The University of Guelph (Guelph, ON), Douglas College (Coquitlam, BC) and the Augustana Campus of the University of Alberta were the first three academic libraries in Canada to have a human library all starting within months of each other in the 2008-2009 academic year. While the augustana human library is based on the principles noted at the founding human library webpage (humanlibrary.org), it has been expanded to also include as Human Books individuals who have experienced a significant and unique life experience not necessarily affected by prejudice and stereotypes. In particular, the ""readings"" on offer at the augustana human library detail lived experiences of prejudice, stereotypes and/or unique life stories -all of which offer the Readers insight into the lives of Human Books. The Human Library concept was quickly embraced during the planning process. The Augustana Campus has a curriculum which endeavors to challenge students on social issues and responsibility and encourages understanding and tolerance in their back yards and across the world.
Sample themes discussed by Human Books in the augustana human library include transgendered persons, living with AIDS, lesbian marriage, atheism, farm economic stress and its effects on marriage/family, substance abuse, domestic violence, depression, environmental debate over conventional/organic land practices, adult perspective of being sexually abused as a child, adoption, male feminism, the raising of an autistic child, and many more! Additional information about each of the augustana human library events including titles and abstracts of Human Books, is available at www.library.ualberta.ca/augustana/infolit/humanlibrary/.

The Human Library as an Extension of Information Literacy at Augustana
The augustana human library has a librarian-led research project associated with it. Other academic libraries or librarians who have published researchrelated results on a Human Library include Preston College 1 and Garbutt 2 and many other libraries have reflective reports on their websites. During each augustana human library, each Human Book completes a pre-event and post-event questionnaire and each Reader completes a pre-read and post-read questionnaire so as to assess the value of the program as perceived by all participants. While there have been four augustana human library events to date, ethics coverage was not in place for research and reporting purposes for the initial two events. As a result, the organizers have a much richer data pool for organizational decision making than for publication. For all questionnaires, basic demographic questions are asked regarding gender, age, year of study, discipline of study and institutional affiliation. The following data has been collected only from the winter and fall 2010 events.
Regarding Human Books, there were 22 participants between the two events (though data only reflects responses provided in the questionnaires and not all Human Books completed questionnaires as they are optional). Responses to the question ""What is your gender?"" were 65% (13 of 20) male, 30% (6 of 20) female and 5% (1 of 20) selected the response ""I prefer not to answer. "" Given that the Human Library is about prejudice and stereotypes, organizers thought that consideration of the experience by gender could present interesting data. However, in retrospect, the question has two problems: the use of the word gender instead of sex and the limited response options (""male"", ""female"" and ""I prefer not to answer"") provided to participants. For future events, the question will be revised to ask individuals ""What is your sex?"" as sex refers to a person's biological and physical characteristics and gender refers to the social construction of what society deems to be masculine or feminine. Ironically, answering this kind of question where one must label oneself into a category is the kind of thing which haunts some individuals each day. So that Human Books and Readers are not put into this position in the future, additional response options will be considered for any upcoming events. Other questions asked to determine the demographic makeup related to age (age ranges between 18 and 50+ were all represented) and institution affiliation (Human Books originated from the general public, as well as from the faculty, staff, alumni and students of Augustana, providing numerous connections between the campus and local communities).
The following questions and results are samples from the pre-read questionnaire for Human Books at the two augustana human library events of 2010 (each with likert-style scaled responses from strongly disagree to strongly agree):
1. In my opinion, I will experience a low degree of tension/disagreement in my Human Book conversations. a. 70% (14 of 20) responded agree/strongly agree that they anticipated a low degree of tension/disagreement.
In my opinion, I have broad experience with my chosen Human Book topic.
a. 95% (19 of 20) responded agree/strongly agree The post-read questionnaire for the Human Books also included the following questions (each with likert-style scaled responses from strongly disagree to strongly agree):
1. In my opinion my experience as a Human Book was a positive experience. a. 100% (17 of 17) responded agree/strongly agree 2. In my opinion, Readers benefited very much from my Human Book topic.

The most challenging part of being a Human

Speaking in front of a group of people g. When there was only one person in the group, it was more difficult Responses from Readers were very positive and certainly validate the Human Library's contribution to the institution's extra-curricular context. Organizers who facilitated the gathering of pre-read and post-read questionnaires observed frustration with Readers regarding the completion of the forms when the Reader took out more than one Human Book over the course of the event. Readers often asked if they could fill out one form after the event but at the time of inquiring they rarely know when the last book they will take will be scheduled so this presents an inadequate solution. Additional work is required to strengthen the questions and refine the data gathering process so that the data gathered is of the most significant value. A variety of demographics questions were asked on both the pre-read and post-read questionnaires including gender, age range, institutional affiliation (student, faculty, alumni, public, etc.), year of student and discipline of study (students only) and if the Reader has taken out a Human Book at previous events. The following questions were also asked in the pre-read questionnaire for Readers at the two augustana human library events of 2010 (each with likert-style scaled responses from strongly disagree to strongly agree): a. 31% (43 of 139) responded agree/strongly agree Additionally, the Readers were asked in the postread questionnaire for ideas for future Human Books and comments or questions regarding their experience of reading this Human Book?

All responses from the pre-read and post-read questionnaires were entered into Augustana's open source information literacy assessment software WASSAIL (additional information on WASSAIL can be found at http://www.library.ualberta.ca/augustana/ infolit/wassail/). WASSAIL allows analysis of data comparing responses across different augustana human library events. For example, responses associated with a particular Human Book, responses from a particular demographic (e.g. students, biology majors, women), etc.
ACRL 2011
One of the more unique components of the augustana human library is that student attendees are encouraged to cite the Human Books that they have ""read"" in their undergraduate research papers. This gives librarians an opportunity to discuss citation requirements with students when citing such an information source, as well as the notion of ""what is information?"" Students are thus challenged to think beyond the book, periodical, web paradigm when considering sources of information and the contexts in which different kinds of information sources are, or may not be, appropriate. Teaching faculty are emailed to inform them of this practice of students citing Human Books and students are encouraged to check with faculty that this practice is acceptable in their courses' context.
The final manner in which the augustana human library contributes to the university curriculum is by explicitly inviting Readers to follow-up with a librarian if additional information on the topic of the Human Book is desired. Readers indicate their desire on the post-read questionnaire that they would like to be contacted by a librarian for assistance in gathering additional information relevant to their augustana human library experience/topic (for research or personal purposes). This creates opportunities for the librarian to assist the student in further developing research and information literacy skills.
Human Book Selection and Orientation
Human Books are selected by event organizers in a very controlled manner requiring personal verbal or written references from persons known to the augustana human library organizers. This is done to assure validity and appropriateness of each Human Book's personal narrative. It is important that Human Books understand that they are not to proselytize or recruit or counsel or spread propaganda to Readers. Their role is to tell their story as a personal narrative and not feel pressured or inclined to represent their story as consistent with all persons who have suffered similar prejudice or life experience. Human Books are provided with preparatory materials based on resources provided at by the Human Library Organization at humanlibrary.org 3 and a one-hour orientation session provided by the augustana human library organizers. One benefit of the orientation session is that it provides an opportunity for the Human Books to meet other Human Books prior to the event. Additionally, Human Books are provided with guidelines regarding behavioral expectations of all participants and suggestions of how to plan the telling of their story. For many Human Books, this will be the first time they have verbalized their story beginning to end, to persons known or unknown to them. They are encouraged in their preparations to do things like making a list of key points they want to cover, considering their biggest fears of the experience, imagining the difficult questions Readers might ask and assessing their readiness, or not, to respond. Human Books are also involved in the creation of a title and abstract for themselves. Titles are often intentionally provocative (similar to the title of this article) to catch the interest of the Reader but are always done with the agreement of the Human Book. Human Books are volunteers although some Human Libraries will provide coverage for expenses and/or a token gift of appreciation.
Publicity and Visual Identity
A variety of promotional efforts have been made regarding the advertisement of the augustana human library. The largest challenge is educating people on what a human library is succinctly. This can be a challenge in the limited format of a campus newsletter, a library LCD screen, or a poster. The best recruitment of Readers comes from word of mouth as others experience the event as Human Books or Readers. The augustana human library is open to Augustana Campus students, staff and faculty as well as members of the public. So, while campus tools have a degree of success in terms of advertising, consideration must be given to viable, effective and affordable external options.
In creating for the augustana human library a visual identity, consideration was given to the desired message behind the graphical representation. The notion of conversation was decided to be the key element of the desired message; and, ironically, a Creative Commons graphic called ""Conversation"" was found at flickr.com and used, with permission, as the primary visual identity of the augustana human library.
An additional component of the branding effort can be seen in the ""Conversation"" flowers after the phrase ""augustana human library. "" The words reflect what the organizers aim to achieve in the provision of the event: growing with people, growing in community, growing our world. This component promotes a number of different ideas: the ""people"" as individuals with stories to share, the ""community"" that grows from the sharing of intimate stories and living with March 30-April 2, 2011, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania personal differences, and the growth in our ""world"", big and small, that comes from challenging and facing prejudice and stereotypes. The name augustana human library always appears in lowercase letters and in bold as part of the visual identity.
The following is the resulting branding:
Word of mouth from the good work of other Human Libraries serves to promote any Human Library. An article in The Globe and Mail, Canada's national newspaper, made a reference to an upcoming human library in Alberta (the first augustana human library) which resulted in inquires to the organizers prior to the first event. 4 This occurred only because the University of Guelph's human library was featured in the article.
Behind the Scenes
The planning of a Human Library can be as complex and involved or as simple as the organizers desire. To a great degree, the model of the human library employed affects the nature and complexity of planning required. Most human libraries are less structured than the augustana human library and would advertise a window of time that Human Books are available and readings are first-come-first-served or, alternatively, scheduled at mutually agreeable times. 5 All models have strengths and weaknesses but the augustana human library organizers desired the context where Human Books were available at a pre-advertised time as we did not have the technological infrastructure to facilitate online advance booking and we desired a single event rather than an ongoing event. As well, Human Books in the augustana human library are selected through a more informal process of personal recommendations because the infrastructure is not in place to interview potential Human Books.
On the financial side of things a human library can be run at low to minimal cost. However, there are situations which arise which do benefit from financial backing. A number of examples would include:
1. Advertisements in the local media are effective as this method targets the largest number of potential participants. 2. During the Human Library it is important to serve refreshments for the Human Books and the Readers so that the reads have the desired ""going out for coffee"" feel 3. There are a number of potential costs associated with the orientation, hosting and thanking of Human Books a. If there are orientation sessions, there are potential costs such as printing of handouts and refreshments. b. Not all books can provide their own transportation to/from the event so funding to support bus passes, taxi rides, etc would be appropriate. c. Some books may come from outside the region and require overnight stay. In this case, appropriate per diem and accommodation costs may come into play. d. A token thank-you gift for the Human Book's participation is common.
Highlights
Without exception, the reported experiences by Human Books and Readers of the augustana human library have been positive. Anecdotally, participants verbally reported a sense of humility and humanity that touched them deeply. The level of trust and respect, even where people might have fundamentally disagreed on issues, was palpable. Descriptive responses provided as part of the research study's preread and post-read questionnaire affirmed for organizers that the event was a success in the many ways success could be measured.

James Kariuki (Human Book: ""More Than A Color, "" Experienced Racism) ""I found it empowering to look back on my life and realize that I have met or adapted to many challenging situations. "" Donna Schroeder (Human Book: ""I See, "" Visually Impaired) Although the augustana human library is located on the Augustana Campus of the University of Alberta in Camrose (one hour from Alberta's capital city of Edmonton), the augustana human library was featured on the front page of the Edmonton Journal. The story featured a Human Book titled ""A Father's Heart"" which was the story of a father whose infant baby died, who adopted an infant from Haiti, and who parents a Down's syndrome 12-year old son. 6 
Conclusion
While the model of the augustana human library is still evolving because every event offers new insights to planners, it is safe to say that the event is fully embraced by the Augustana Campus community as well as the general public. Ongoing challenges include securing stable budget support for the event. As well, the research project is evolving and the data gathering process and the questions asked requires assessment. Working with faculty on a variety of curricular-related options is being considered. The notion of a human library with the Augustana Library will develop more and more with time and will meet with continued success on the strength of formal advertising and word of mouth. It most certainly will continue to be an event that brings a diverse group of people to the Augustana Library both from within and from beyond the boundaries of Augustana campus.

The Human Library, initially developed by the Danish NGO 'Stop the Violence' in 2000, is now held in more than 40 countries, with the aim of promoting intercultural understanding through dialogue. Japan is no exception, with an increasing number of universities, NPOs, NGOs and corporations organising the Library as an exercise in diversity training and intercultural education. This paper provides a first-person narrative of preparation, challenges and success of a one-day Human Library administered by 30 undergraduate students and their supervisor at a Japanese university. It reports preliminary findings of the outcomes of the Library, including increased knowledge and empathy of 'readers' (listeners), increased self-reflexivity of 'books' (storytellers) and transcendence of the Self-Other imaginations of 'librarians' (student organisers). The findings support the raison d'être of the Human Library as a bridge between people of different backgrounds and as a powerful instrument to nurture students' capacities to act on differences. The possibilities and limits of holding the Human Library in a campus setting are also considered.
",2011,Aplis,,"Introduction to the Human Library
The Human Library, initially developed by the Danish NGO 'Stop the Violence' in 2000, is now held in more than 40 countries, with the aim of promoting intercultural understanding through dialogue. The Human Library website states the following:
In its initial form the Human Library is a mobile library set up as a space for dialogue and interaction. Visitors to a Human Library are given the opportunity to speak informally with 'people on loan'; this latter group being extremely varied in age, sex and cultural background.
The Human Library enables groups to break stereotypes by challenging the most common prejudices in a positive and humorous manner. It is a concrete, easily transferable and affordable way of promoting tolerance and understanding [1].
In Japan, the first Human Library was launched in Kyoto in 2008, by the initiative of Living Library Japan, which is stationed at the University of Tokyo Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology. Since then, an increasing number of universities, NPOs, NGOs and corporations have shown interest in the Library as an exercise in diversity training and intercultural education. As of 1 March 2011, the Human Library has been held 18 times in Japan.
In this paper, four students and their supervisor (the first author) at a Japanese university provide a first-person narrative of their preparation, challenges, and success of Dokkyo Human Library, which was open during the university festival in October 2010. (Note that the event was then called 'Dokkyo Living Library', as we followed the accepted practice of the Living Library Japan. In that year a copyright issue was raised by an American company named Living Library, and at present the original Danish name 'Menneske Biblioteket' is officially and more accurately translated as 'Human Library'.) Despite its great potential to create intergroup harmony as well as to foster rapid growth on a global scale, the Human Library has thus far gained only modest scholarly attention. For this reason, we write this paper in a descriptive tone to allow readers to follow the reflective path that 30 students and one faculty organiser took to conduct this event. Primarily, this paper aims to report preliminary findings of the outcomes of the Library in a campus setting, to trigger theoretical and practical discussions for further developments of the Human Library in Japan and the world.
Preparation
The Dokkyo Human Library project was conducted between May 2010 and March 2011. It was initiated as part of an upper-level undergraduate seminar on intercultural communication. The course was designed to enhance students' understanding of the dynamic interplay between culture and communication, particularly from the viewpoints of personal growth and change through face-to-face interactions. In this respect, the concept of the Human Library was consistent with the aim of this course, as the Library would not only bring new people together but also promote understanding between people of various backgrounds who rarely meet in daily life.
The execution of the event comprised three stages: preparation, opening of the Library and post hoc evaluation. As 'librarians' (organisers), our task was to recruit 'books' (storytellers), to raise funds to cover expenses and to advertise the event to attract 'readers' (listeners). During the preparation period, which lasted for six months (May-October), we faced three major difficulties: recruiting books, fundraising, and sustaining the motivation of student organisers. As regards advertising, we held an optimistic view that the general public would come to our campus festival, while we promoted our Library through the internet blog, academic and professional organisation mailing lists, and flyers and posters circulated in schools and shops near the university.
2,463. This is the total number of emails that one of our student organisers sent and received, in order to open Dokkyo Human Library. We needed the engagement and active involvement of many people who could understand and collaborate, to achieve our vision. That is, we needed to promote our vision to promote intercultural understanding through dialogue, while constantly soliciting the cooperation of others. For this purpose, we decided to create a catchy statement of our aim, and after hours of discussion, we established 'Discovering the unknown self' as the theme of Dokkyo Human Library. The theme reflected the self-forming nature of intercultural encounters [2] and coincided with the notion of 'intersubjective storytelling', in which each storyteller's individual agency becomes dependent on others' agency and thus becomes 'I am me, through you' [3, p. 167].
Our preparation started with the recruitment of books. We relied on a practical guide to the Human Library, which suggests a brainstorming session that involves listing on a flipchart those people who face prejudices and stereotyping in our society [4]. Thus, 30 students started to search for so-called 'minority' people who the 'majority' people hardly meet. However, this minority-majority distinction seemed to us inappropriate and even discriminatory, because the term 'minority' is usually associated with a lower social status [5]. We then came up with the idea of calling them 'unique' instead of 'minority'; yet, our feeling of awkwardness did not diminish by this simple relabeling. Many of our student members thought that 'they' (the minorities/unique) were very different and distant from 'us' (the majority). We also positioned ourselves in the dichotomy of 'us within university' and 'them outside university'. The discourse of such a student-worker distinction is pervasive in Japan, as people tend to believe that university students, after going through a moratorium period on campus, turn into shakaijin, full-fledged members of the society or the job market [6].
The challenge was solved by changing our perception of ourselves by contacting various NPOs and associations. Most of us struggled to recruit books until we realised that 'they' have common interests and values with 'us'. They may be blind and unable to walk, or they may have a particular type of appearance or career. However, by listening to their life histories, many of us came to realise that they live just the way we live, and they even tell jokes. After this awakening, or transcending of difference, occurred, the psychological barrier we had constructed in our minds disappeared, and we could communicate much better and more easily with the prospective books.
Overall, we approached 21 organisations (i.e. NPOs, NGOs, volunteer groups, corporations, and governments) and nine individuals who we found on the web and through word-of-mouth introductions. We were aware that most people would not become books unless they found some merits in doing so. We therefore attempted to offer advantages from their standpoint. For example, we told them the following advantages:
The Human Library is a good place to promote your work. [NPOs] The Human Library provides people with opportunities to know you and to reconsider what a society should be like.
['minorities']

The Human Library may contribute to the improvement of the public's image of who and what you are. [Japan's Defence Forces]
Through much persuasion and negotiation, we finally recruited the following 18 books: an albino patient, an alopecia patient, a person with a 'unique face' (angioma), a blind person, a blind soccer player, a commissioner of an NPO on wheelchairs, the family of a person who had committed suicide, two sexual minorities, a global tourist, two foreign residents, a house husband, a Buddhist nun, a voice actor of silent movies, and three officials of Japan's Self-Defence Force. Some of them came from the local community, whereas the others came from distant areas. Each book was given instructions on the Human Library by two or three students, who helped to make a title and storyline of reading sessions (i.e. conversations) through face-to-face or mediated (e.g. email or telephone) contact. We attempted to keep regular contact with the books to hear and relieve their concerns and worries as storytellers.
A second central issue of the preparation was raising funds. Although the participation of the books in Dokkyo Human Library was voluntary, we still required approximately ¥100,000 (US$1,200) to cover expenses for public transport of the books and for refreshments. Because of the recent economic recession as well as people's unfamiliarity with the Human Library, our attempt to raise monetary sources through door-to-door tactics was not as successful as we had initially hoped. We attempted to approach our university, but the university did not have a policy to offer grants for events organised by a single class. Then, we asked our university alumni for donations by writing them letters, and this method was successful.
A third major difficulty of the preparation was to sustain our own motivation as organisers for a long period. There were times when many students struggled to cooperate with others who showed varying degrees of motivation and actual commitment to the Human Library project. Initially, most of the 30 students were not familiar with the Human Library itself; because of other personal and academic interests and commitments and partly because of inadequate circulation of information among organisers, many students made fewer contributions than a limited number of highly motivated students. As a result, in-group cooperation was difficult. However, the group maintained a certain degree of collaboration with strong leadership, and a few small events such as a mock Human Library involving the alumni and in-class interviews with prospective books significantly helped to raise morale.
Dokkyo Human Library
Dokkyo Human Library opened in a new classroom building in October 2010. Before the first reading session began, we held a 30-minute orientation for the books. The content included self-introductions of librarians and books and reconfirmation of reading rules. Then, at 10 a.m. the first registration began. Readers came to the reception, and the librarians explained to each reader the rules of the Human Library, including reading books with care and respect and preserving their privacy. We asked each reader to agree to these rules and sign a consent form. After signing it, the readers reserved a book. After placing their reservation, they went to a room where the book awaited and participated in a reading. On that single day, a total of 16 books and 72 readers (121 gross registrants) partook in the Library. (Note that two Books withdrew from participation because a typhoon hit the university area two days before the Library began and their intermediary judged it better not to send them.) Each reading session lasted 30 minutes. We provided not only dialogue sessions (1-3 readers per book) but also lecture sessions (1-50 readers per book). We held two types of sessions to maximise opportunities for readers to meet the books. In the dialogue sessions, both books and readers could engage in heart-to-heart conversations. In the lecture session, a larger number of readers, including those who could not reserve books, could listen and talk to the books in a question-and-answer format, prompted by librarians.
We also attempted to promote off-session dialogue among books, readers, and librarians by providing opportunities for socialisation. Around noon, the books and some librarians had a lunch break together in the same open space. A courtesy lunchbox was provided for each book. This relaxation time and space particularly helped the books to talk to other books and share their experiences as storytellers and active agents of everyday life. Concurrently, a group of librarians gave an introductory lecture about the Human Library in a different room, with a focus on the history of the Library and its missions, for the readers and general attendees of the university festival who happened to be in the vicinity of the Library. At 3 p.m. all reading sessions ended. Then, we held a reflection session, in which all the books, voluntarily solicited readers, and selected librarians (approximately 30 people in total) talked for 90 minutes in small groups about the possible effects of the Human Library. The main discussion question was what these participants could discover from the one-day event. Primarily, the books and readers were asked to exchange opinions about what they thought or felt during conversations. Also addressed was the theme of Dokkyo Human Library: 'Discover the unknown self'. At the heart of this reflection was the belief that experience alone is not sufficient, because it is both awareness of experiencing otherness and ability to analyse the experience and act upon the insights that are essential to promoting intercultural understanding or 'being intercultural' [7, p. 4].
Finally, we held a party to facilitate greater interactions among all the participants as well as to express our gratitude to the books who made vital contributions to the Library. The party attendees enjoyed refreshments and informal conversations in a more relaxed mood. The function and thus the entire event ended around 7 p.m.
Evaluation
The literature shows that a majority of readers and books express favourable comments about their experience of the Human Library [8] [9]. Some discuss the possibility of snowballing or ripple effects, in which the readers' experience of debunking the stereotypes of books extends beyond the book-reader dyad and spreads across a local community [8] [10]. Others suggest that regular openings of the Library contribute to community development [8]. Still others discern a modest view that the effects of the Human Library might be only temporary, particularly the effects of a one-time Library such as ours, and that it is necessary to perform more systematic analysis of the long-term effects from a wide array of theoretical standpoints (e.g. intergroup contact theories, cosmopolitanism, politics of representation and listening) [10]. In addition, most studies focus on the effects of the book-reader dialogue, providing much scope to investigate other relations, such as those between books and librarians.
With such characteristics of the literature in mind, the 30 students and one faculty organiser of Dokkyo Human Library conjointly carried out the preliminary analysis of the outcomes of the Library by using four methods: (1) post hoc questionnaire and interviews with the books, (2) on-site questionnaire and interviews with the readers, (3) focus groups with student organisers of other two Human Libraries run in Tokyo in 2010 and (4) continuous self-reflection in seminar classes subsequent to the Library. During our preparation for the Library, we studied the 'contact hypothesis' [11], and to evaluate the outcomes of the Library, we could have considered its four pillars as preconditions for the reduction of prejudice: pursuing a common goal, equal status, personal intimacy, and sanction from authority [12]. However, we decided not to limit our focus by using this social psychological approach, considering the rudimentary nature of Human Library research to date. Instead, we chose to identify general themes of what three players-readers, books, and librarians-could learn, so that readers of our study could use our experience as a sound basis for theoretical reflections and as a practical tool to carry out other modes of Human Libraries in future.
It is beyond the scope of this paper to address all emerging outcomes of the Library. Thus, we focus on three major findings: (1) increased knowledge, understanding and empathy of the readers (listeners), (2) increased self-reflexivity of the books (storytellers) and (3) transcending the Self-Other imaginations of the librarians (student organisers).
Increased knowledge and empathy of the readers
The readers seemed to grow in their knowledge and interest in difference and diversity, and many reported empathic understanding of the books. Among 72 registered readers, 23 responded to an on-site questionnaire about demographic information (age, sex, occupation and location of residence), motives and opinions of reading sessions. Of the 23 respondents, 22 (95.6%) agreed that Dokkyo Human Library contributed to 'discovering the unknown self.' Twenty respondents (86.9%) acknowledged that they would recommend others to join the Library. These high figures are consistent with evaluations at other inaugural Human Libraries [8] [9]. Most respondents expressed an awakening of new values and broadening of perspectives through direct conversations with the books.
Below are some comments solicited from the questionnaire and semi-structured interviews:
I didn't know that anyone can play blind soccer, so I want to try it.
Alopecia is not only a physical problem but also a mental problem. The more I knew her thoughts, the more I felt heartbreaking grief.
Thinking about homosexuality, many people would think that the normal is heterosexual and that the abnormal is homosexual. I used to think both sexual orientations were OK, but I now realise that I was still making a clear distinction between the two, which is not right.
My fear of religion disappeared.
I used to feel that the officers of the Self-Defence Force were rigid, but after meeting him, I felt that he is friendly.
However, any generalisation based on these positive evaluations must be treated with care because our sample was small and homogeneous. In demographic terms, most respondents were university students (n=13: 56.5%) in their twenties (n=16: 69.5%), and a vast majority of the respondents came from distant areas (n=20: 86.9%). In addition, no conclusive generalisations can be made about the positive effects of attitudinal change, as nine respondents (39.1%) were already interested in the Library prior to coming to Dokkyo Human Library and 13 respondents (56.5%) were not first-timers. Future evaluations of this kind will have to target a larger number of people who are more diverse in demography and who are not sensitised to diversity issues beforehand. Nevertheless, the entire perception of the Library among the readers was positive, and no negative comments were reported by the readers except for a few humble requests for a longer duration (i.e. more than 30 minutes) of the reading session.
Increased self-reflexivity of the books
We carried out a survey and conducted interviews with the books. Of 16 books, 11 returned our questionnaire with answers in two weeks and three participated in post hoc interviews within one or two months after the Library ended. Of the 11 respondents, including the three interviewees, six (54.5%) were first-timers to a Human Library and five (45.5%) were second-or third-timers, whose first participation had taken place within a year. It should be noted that all the books were relatively new to the event, and therefore, the following evaluation may reflect their sense of novelty.
In general, the books' reactions, too, were positive, particularly from the viewpoint of promoting their reflexivity on the storytelling experience and daily life. For example, nine out of 11 respondents (81.8%) held the opinion that Dokkyo Human Library helped them to 'discover the unknown self'. In response to a subsequent open-ended question about what they meant by discovering the unknown self, many commented on greater self-reflexivity through conversations with the readers and other books: I found that I truly want and like to communicate with others, more than anything else. In responding to the readers' sincere questions, I realised that I wanted to tell all my experiences to them.
This whole world is interesting. [From this opportunity] I received courage to go one step further.
If I step further with courage, many people will accept me. It's an ordinary thing, but it was nice that I could find it.
We also asked the books about their pre-event expectations by an open-ended question in the survey. We categorised their responses into six recurrent themes: (1) meeting new people, (2) reducing social prejudice, (3) gaining others' acceptance, (4) rethinking self-identity, (5) enjoying the experience and (6) finding something new. These categories were consistent with responses to a five-point Likert scale on the subjective feelings of participation (i.e. significance-insignificance, easiness-difficulty, security-anxiety, understanding-incomprehension and enjoyment-boredom). Except for the dimension of easiness (from 2.91 to 2.73), the mean rates showed positivity: after the Library, the books tended to find more security (from 3.09 to 3.73), significance (from 4.36 to 4.73), understanding (from 3.45 to 3.91) and enjoyment (from 3.91 to 4.64).
With regard to programme management, however, there remained areas for improvement. Several books remarked that they should have been given more concrete and detailed instructions for (Dokkyo) Human Library and their expected roles as a book beforehand. As shown in the perception of decreased easiness (from 2.91 to 2.73), a few reported potential difficulties in conversation due to snide remarks by the readers and a lack of adequate socio-emotional support by student librarians. The books should have been allocated more time to prepare sufficiently, possibly through face-to-face consultation or role plays or even through an SNS (e.g. Skype). An important implication of these comments is that more benefits of the Human Library should be sought and co-created between the books and the librarians through strategic and collaborative preparations.
Transcending the Self-Other imaginations of the librarians
As mentioned in Preparation, one significant aspect of student-run events such as this is the discourse of the student-worker/shakaijin dichotomy that is pervasive in the Japanese society [6]. While the student organisers, the vast proportion of whom had identified themselves as 'majority', were trying to find the 'minorities/unique' as prospective books, they felt disadvantaged and marginalised by the 'society' as (if they were) the 'minority' (or possibly 'unique'), or people with a lower status. As economically weak individuals dependent on their parents, some students were met with suspicion and frowns by the workers/shakaijin when they asked for donations to hold the Library. As junior 'half-adult' citizens in a vertical society, others felt obliged or compelled to obey senior 'adults' when any chance of disagreement arose. As a young female, one student struggled to convince an older male reader to respect the rules of the Library. All of these subtleties provided us with a productive focus on the issues of privilege and power in the broader societal context.
Arguably, the term that most succinctly describes the main outcomes of Dokkyo Human Library for student librarians is the transcendence of Self-Other imaginations. It is has been argued in the critical approach to intercultural communication that the privileged/powerful Self is constructed in opposition to, or at the expense of, the imaginably denigrated/powerless Other [13]. This unequal Self-Other relation is a hallmark of many incidents of intergroup bias, intolerance and conflict. Conversely, we believe that as individuals, by organising a Human Library, we achieved the relational transcendence of the 'us'-'them' dichotomy in the pursuit of a common goal, which was to open Dokkyo Human Library to create a secure space for intercultural dialogues.
Anecdotally, several student organisers reported greater socio-emotional interconnectedness through collaborative preparation for the Library. For example, one student approached an NPO which addresses issues of physical appearance. She had originally avoided people with distinct physical characteristics because she did not know how to communicate with them. Then, she met an albino gentleman. Through continual interaction and preparation with him, she discovered that they shared many personal similarities and formed a deep friendship with him. Now she goes to karaoke and enjoys drinking with him and his colleagues. Another student contacted an NPO which assists in fostering the independence of people with disabilities. She felt uneasy about interacting with such people until she met an executive officer of the organisation, who uses a wheelchair and is a strong advocate of inclusive city planning and development for all disabled and non-disabled people. She had previously felt nervous contacting him by telephone or email, but now she is a frequent participant in volunteer events run by his NPO.
The common theme between the stories of these two students, as well as that of many others, is that the Dokkyo Human Library project became a strong impetus to reflect on our identities and positions in relation to the others in the society. Through organising the event, we learned that the Self-Other identification and distinction could be made on the basis of various criteria such as age, sex/gender, culture, occupation, physical characteristics, economic status, and even motivation for the Human Library. We also learned that through prolonged engagement with the books in pursuit of a common goal (although a more strategic co-creation of the goal could have been practiced), we could bridge preordained intergroup differences by transcending the Self-Other dichotomy and transforming it into interconnectedness. Although our evaluation of outcomes of the Library is still rudimentary, we believe that our Human Library could serve as a strong bridge between people of different backgrounds and as a powerful instrument to nurture our capacities to act on differences.
Conclusions
Through the Dokkyo Human Library project, we faced numerous challenges and had precious new encounters. As university student/staff organisers, we found that the Library was a very effective strategy for changing the perceptions of the readers, librarians, and even books. We also found that the Library was very useful in revisiting our position and status in society and in cultivating our social and generic skills through active engagement with the society [14]. Considering that most existing evaluations of the outcomes of Human Libraries are atheoretical and rudimentary, research institutions such as universities can and should play vital roles in further development of the Human Library. However, our experience reveals that holding the Library in a university setting is not without limits and problems.
Based on our findings, some of the emerging tasks for future practitioners and researchers are as follows:  Thus far, we know very little about the possibility of the university as a site for the Human Library. One possibility from our earlier discussion of the 'us'-'them' dichotomy is that the university may not be as open and welcoming to the general public as city libraries or other public spaces to hold this event. Another option is, of course, that the university could go out of the ivory tower of academia to make efforts to be open to the local community. Nevertheless, further exploration of the spatiality of the Human Library in relation to its surroundings is necessary.  In addition, we know little about the possible impacts of the frequency/timing of the Human Library at university on the perceived socio-emotional outcomes. The favourable results of our one-off Library could be attributed simply to the novelty of the event (i.e. a special event during the university festival), rather than to the success of rigorous preparation and evaluation. The issue of timing should be addressed with a fundamental question: For what reasons and purposes, and for whom, should the Human Library be held?  To date, there are few reports on the possible links between the Human Library and other types of educational programmes such as intercultural and diversity training, and foreign language instructions. The Human Library techniques, for example, are easily transferable to international student orientations or intercultural events in which international and home students could sit and talk together to cross the divide between the two student groups and facilitate greater interactions on campus. Personal relationships and networks that are created through the Human Library could also be used as a resource for other creative research and educational activities.
It is our sincere hope that future research and educational practices will not only improve the quality of the Human Library but also create new knowledge that will help celebrate diversity and enhance peace in our globalising world.",5610,6259

Human Library initially between one kind of person and person through dialogue to reduce the bias, encourage the understanding of educational activities. In the activity, provide a relatively flexible and loose dialogue and exchange place Human Library for the reader, the real books of different types of readers; understand each other through to communicate with the aim of eliminating prejudice. In recent years, Human Library has developed to the professional knowledge, subject and trend.
A. Human Library origin
In twentieth Century 90 in the early 1990s, Copenhagen Denmark Ronnie burger in five young launched a ""stop violence (Stop the Violence)"" non-governmental you th organizations, trying toper education way to persuade young people against violence. They think that everyone has a tendency to violence; if there is a chance with his enemy face to face communication, have the opportunity to resolve the misunderstanding, the elimination of violence. In 2000 July, at the Roskilde Music Festival, ""stop the violence"" organization has lent 75 books ""real books (Human Book, also called Living Book)"", and achieved very good results, obtained the positive evaluation of the society. Human Library (also called Living Library) the resulting.
B. Human Library practice at home and abroad
Human Library since 2000 in Denmark has appeared, soon spread to other countries, causing the local library circles, and implanted in the service of the library. Such as the Copenhagen Public Library Central Library of Denmark in 2005 organized the first real library activities. In Sweden in 2006, the library of Malmo city hosted the reality of library activities, this is the earliest of the reality of Library activities. In 2008 October, real library first landed in America, the venue for the city of California USA Panicked Santa Monica public library, then had 14 the real books can be lent, content mainly includes the nudists, Buddhists, vegetarian, well-known publishing house, Oaxaca Americans, homeless women and so on [1].

Finally, by 15 LIS experts as a ""real books"" participants ""borrowing"". Since then, the university library more and more domestic began to try the Human Library activity.
II. ACADEMIC LIBRARIES COMBINED STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS TO CARRY OUT HUMAN LIBRARY

ADVANTAGE
College student association is the campus informal groups, are the students in learning, life according to the interests and hobbies, voluntary, according to the articles of association of independent activities, students organization. According to incomplete statistics, the national average in each college has 40 student clubs, 50, more than 60% students belonging to one or several societies, and more than 90% of the students took part in some activities held by the club. This shows that in recent years, with the continuous deepening of reform of higher education system and the comprehensive promotion of quality education, the number and the number of students associations are flourishing in China [5].
A. Student associations more easy to explore the quality of Human Books
Human Library Human Books is a decisive factor, directly related to the success or failure of the activity, so as much as possible to explore various types of high quality Human Books became the first should be taken into consideration. University library environment is relatively closed, can come into contact with some of the more specialist schools of scholars, although it could lead to a Human Library to the subject, the knowledge of the UMAN direction of development, but easy to fall into the didactic mode, can not cause the student reader's interest, but also in the organization of experience is not mature conditions can easily evolve into the traditional lecture instead, the essence of the meaning of Human Library. All the members of student organizations are from the students, they become more familiar with and understand the various ""around your expert"" and special experience of the people. These people may be experts in study, may be a specialist (not necessarily academic fields), and also may be just one in the process of growing different story man. In order to carry out the activities of the early Paragraph, such Human Books sure to attract more students to the reader's eye. And because Human Books is as a volunteer, by the student society's classmate invitation is also easier to persuade them to Human Library as Human Books. In addition to the school resources, through the college student association association relationship can also go to other colleges and universities of high quality Human Books, so as to provide the dynamics of Library activity of Human in University library.
B. Student associations active thinking, propaganda way more plentiful
Already in today's society, information dissemination way become diverse, and college students are undoubtedly the most sensitive group new things. Their active thinking, quick response to all kinds of new media, the community more Canglongwohu, design, planning, art, cal ligraphy,photography and other professional talents are numerous, provide rich human resources guarantee for the inevitable Human Library propaganda work. Production, from the early posters publicity slogans, to the end of the news release, student associations have incomparable advantages over the single community library. They can be the first time perception on the network popular language, with novel copy to reveal and ""read some characteristics of each of the Human Book"", arousing the readers interest; can also use micro blogs and other new mediator quickly will Human Library the concept spread to the deep heart, and after the event quickly through all kinds of video website will the activity process release out to harvest more attention activities; also can be the most convenient understanding current hot readers concern, targeted to find ""the book for readers"". The university library only use various means to Human__ Library is rooted in the students, to make with endless vitality of the transformation of the way of reading, and not just a flash in the pan.
C. Student organizations can assist libraries in Colleges and universities do a good job in Human Library's organizational work
Human Library wants to continue to carry on, in addition to a rich variety of Human Books, the activities of the organization work is also very important. This includes pre Human Books acquisition, cataloging, indexing, the whole event planning, publicity, making borrowing rules, for the borrowing formalities, venue layout, service related work process of reading and activities after the end of the information feedback. University Library due to both circulation and reading all services, can not put all personnel are deployed to the Human Library organization work, then the student groups, especially the volunteers played a great role.
The library is responsible for formulating the activity rule and the activities of the program in detail, to grasp the scale of activities and processes in general, specific affairs during the period are by the student societies assist. As for Human Books to recruit, screen, arranged the venue, to provide services for the Human Books and the activities of readers, through the questionnaire, individual interviews to collect feedback information and soon after the event. On the vitality of the university students, this new thing can stimulate their enthusiasm and creativity greatly, can provide a stage for their ability to play, but also can solve the problem of the shortage of University library. The recruitment of 1 ""real books"" books source. That is, to fully tap the Human Library in college students' Ideological and political education in the source of books, in addition to make full use of existing school of resources, but also should fully mobilize social resources, the existing resources of campus dominates, outstanding student representative, school, voluntary, have a large stock of information, rich experience and wisdom of the scholars and teachers are the main ""source book"" reality library, at the same time, the social outstanding representative, such as opinion leaders can be incorporated into the ranks of the book source, recruitment form: introductory, alumni recommend, school selection etc.. Determination of the quality of 2 ""real books"" book source book source, ensure that the product Quality. In confirmation of source of quality in the process, should adhere to the principle of orientation, must hold to the correct political orientation. ""Real library"" mode is the typical individual media, in the interactive space relative to private, between the reader and the ""source book"" can be free to express different political views, which is bound to affect the political tradition, political system or the political democratic process. The face value of pluralistic society, everyone has their own outlook on life and value, this is the concept of society is more and more open results. An advocate of free choice society does not mean there is no non social right and wrong. Face in the social transition period of confusion, the ideological and political education workers should insist on the correct outlook on life and value; be in ""real library"" mode, and not for good information, public opinion gatekeeper.
III. THE MODE
The management and protection of 3 ""real books"", mainly for filing and classification for the recruitment of the book source. Book source classification preliminary ideas for: public share class, new knowledge class, social classes and skills category four categories. Public sharing is to help different charity organizations free planning activities, will build into a public book, allowing more people to read it and understand it; the new knowledge is invited to different age and occupation, have different skills, and in their own positions a little result really came to share knowledge, such as the writer and the director, architect, psychological doctor, and so on; social class is having the same characteristics meet each other real books in the library, reading, looking for love. For example, the birthday the same day, or is the constellation of the same, and the so-called ""love"" includes like-minded, honey, lovers; skills also regularly launch real computer operation, manual book, workplace etiquette demonstration, Office operating system, the Western cooking, sewing handmade products skills.
4 Human Library after a period of ""source book"" selection, management, classification and other links, can be applied to college students' Ideological and political education. A good book source selection and classification management based on simple, students can clearly choose their owned to borrow ""real books"" living books source for special counseling to ""borrow"" object, and student exchange in their own areas of expertise, to educate students, enrich their own purpose. The process requirements and the smooth implementation of school counselors to make (1) The individual reading pattern can maximally satisfy the demand of readers. Based on the model of reading Human Library library, ""book"" is played by the personality of the full reality, these ""books"" from all walks of life, with the knowledge structure of a variety of different, can be said to be ""top know astronomy knowledge of geography"" ""very learned,"" borrowing readers is the product read of these ""books"" in particular, the time, the right place, between the reader and the ""book"" in the exchange of information, mutual borrowing rules to gain knowledge, self personality easy access to knowledge, to solve the problem.
(2) The implicit information resources can maximize the mining and utilization. The library collection, collation, preservation as literature and culture educational institutions provide convenience to readers, not only to develop all kinds of dominant resources, such as books, periodicals, pictures, audio, electronic books, tacit resources should also develop and utilize a large number of higher value, such as the type of intelligence information resources and zero literature etc.. The new reading model Human Library is one of the best books on human, channel development recessive resources. People can communicat e face-to-face conversation, which rarely appeared in the literature on the verbal information resources and intellectual resources. German Shang Bailout said ""life is like a book"", everyone is a book worth reading ""the book"", have rich experience can learn, is worth learning place to mining, is the so-called ""three of us are walking together, there must be my teacher behavior"".
(3) Adequate communication can maximize harmonious atmosphere. With the continuous development of network information technology, digitalization and informationization has become the main way of daily office and access to information resources, the exchanges between people less communication barriers, obstacles increase, and not harmonious factor is also more and more.
The Human Library direct communication mode is unique, just make up for defects caused the traditional way of reading, the promotion of human dialogue, enhance mutual understanding, build a harmonious and friendly atmosphere in campus.",2563,2759

A story about a Boy from Brazil, that came from nowhere in a very poor town and that today, on this delightful day is presenting His research at Manchester, to be more precise at the Friends Meeting House. A place that has its own storyâ€¦ Built-in 1828 and serving since then as a place of peacebuilding and social justice.\n2018 is a year to promote humans right, gender equality and to celebrate the difference! Today we can hear more and more the voices of the unheard and through education, we move forward to social cohesion every day more. This paper is called Diversity, recognition and dialogue: The voices of books and readers-listeners in the Intercultural Human Library. This work is the result of an ongoing research-action project under a collaboration protocol between the Institute of Education of the University of Minho and the Municipality of Braga, Portugal.\nThroughout our fact-finding, we found that Discrimination and Prejudice were the top priority of the city regarding the inclusion of immigrants. Our goals were then to understand the potential of mediation for the promotion of interculturality and to analyze new ways of promoting the inclusion of migrants in the city of Braga.\nAs an immigrant myself, this subject is also part of my story and I could talk about it without stopping. Instead, there are 4 important things to point out here today and to make sure you all understand what it is all about I\'ll explain to you. Why Mediation? What is interculturality? What is the Human Library? And why do we need stories? Why Mediation? As humans, one of our greatest gifts is our capacity to communicate as we do. Daniel Webster used to say that if all his possessions were taken but one, he would choose to keep the power to communicate because with that he could regain it allfoot_0 .\nWe perceive Mediation as a process where we construct bridges allowing people to communicate efficiently and through that grow the seeds of mutual recognition, comprehension, positive ways of dealing with conflicts and leaving the tools for everyone to build their own bridges, to plant their own seeds. With that said, it is important to realize that in 2018 we live in a global world and more and more we need to learn how to behave as a global community. The intercultural concept comes into play when we understand that in a global world, communication can sometimes be seen as a dark cloud, an issueâ€¦ Interculturality cleans the sky with the concept that we no longer can live in a world built on the idea that we need to tolerate the different. The one that tolerates does not celebrate. Interculturality comes and teaches us that through the differences we can grow together, celebrating and promoting the difference between all the cultures in the world. Costa (2015) said that in an intercultural world is necessary to create conditions that create the need in people to know each other and share a common goal. With that in mind, we came with the idea of adapting the Human Library concept into the intercultural realm with the main objectives of this intervention being to promote intercultural dialogue and to promote the recognition of different cultures.\nThe Human Library is a method of approaching storytellers with their reader-listeners with the intention of creating dialogue and interaction between them. Human books tell their stories and experiences of emigration and immigration, enhancing respect for human rights and stimulating mutual understanding and recognition. ""The purpose of the Living Library is enabling short, intensive and facilitated contact between Readers and Books -offering those holding possible prejudices to meet the objects of their prejudice"". (Little, Nemutlu, Magic & MolnÃ¡r, 2011, p.16). Research has shown that intergroup contact can significantly reduce harmful stereotypes and demonstrated that prejudice and contact are significantly and inversely correlated.\nDuring our journey, one of the most important parts were finding and preparing the human books. The whole of the Mediator comes into play during this process. By using techniques like active listening and enhancing this moment of developing the book by its potential, we used an approach that while helping the Human books to create their stories we were also creating reflexions and celebrating their life path. This Human Library had 4 books. Each one of them had a completely different story, each a universe to teach something to those who were listening. Here we ask ourselves. What are stories? Aren\'t we all made of stories? Aren\'t we all made of Human History? Aren\'t we all the story that we tell ourselves every morning?\nThomas, Obst and Nolan suggest that ""we care deeply, selflessly about those we know. But that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight"" (Thomas, Obst & Nolan, 2014). So If I\'m looking at you right now, I can see you, I can know you, the real you. Because of that, we took the Human Library into two different contexts. First at a Public Library and second at a public school. We had a total of 58 participants, 21 at the public library, with elders, adults and youth and at the public school, we had 37 teenagers with 22 on the 9th grade and 15 on the 12 grade. We also developed a questionnaire survey to gather qualitative information with the goal of answering the objectives of the project and finding out the potential of the Human Library.\nThrough those surveys we were able to take some conclusions that show us the potential of dialogue and the human library. Of 46 surveys, 44 said that stories told by the person itself through the human presence have more impact than other ways of telling a story. They pointed out the capacity of promoting empathy, facilitating the comprehension of the story and the capacity of keeping the attention of the readerlistener. When asked how they felt during the activity the participants said that it changed their perspective of life, they felt curious to know other cultures and empathy towards the human books. Regarding the educational side of this activity, the participants said that they learned that the world is full of different perspectives, we can learn with others, that it\'s possible to deconstruct prejudice and how important the ""other"" is.\nRegarding the human books, words as honour, gratitude and strong emotions are referenced many times. Through telling their stories and feeling the feedback they said that it is possible to overcome prejudice through communication. They felt Human and not immigrants, they felt the others saw them as humans too and for that only we can say it was helpful regarding mutual recognition.\nThe human library created bridges and planted seeds in the city of Braga. We hope to spread our voice, the immigrant voices. We need stories because we are nothing more than that, and through daring to find new ways of promoting peace we can tell each other brighter stories. So do you have a story to tell?'",1480,1614

What if a book can speak? What if a book can share its emotions? What if a book can share its life journey? What if a book is living? What if a book is a human? Yes, this brings a concept of a living book, which is well known as ""Human Book."" The concept of different forms of knowledge has emerged from the different paradigms of landscapes through books to e-books or digital books and now the human books. The journey from book to human book has emerged with various new concepts and definitions. The knowledge which is expressed by human is termed as retrieval of ideas and stories shared to users and thoughts as various pages. The concept of human library has first started in the year 2000 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The Human Library is an international organization and movement. It aims to address people\'s prejudices by helping them to talk to those they would not normally meet. Human Library is a social platform where a meaningful conversation between people who have been victims of stereotyping and are often judged for their choices or for what they are (Called as Human Books) and people in the society who are curious about these societal stigmas (called as Readers). The human book can also be issued to users as the other books, human books have an honest conversations with readers and the users gain knowledge by listening to others life\'s struggle, their experiences and story of winning the battle of their life and got success. Human Book has a great impact on readers because the book and the readers are involved in the direct conversation and the story can be conveying to users in a more effective way. There are real people, real conversations and a real story therefore the readers can relate to the real life experience.\nWHO CAN BE A HUMAN BOOK?\n""The Human Library is designed to build a positive framework for conversations that can challenge stereotypes and prejudices through dialogue. It is a place where real people are on loan to readers. A place where difficult questions are expected, appreciated and answered,"" explains Harshad Dinkar Fad, founder of Human Library in Hyderabad. A human book has a story to tell gathered from a unique life experience. A Human book can be any person who has their story to tell of their survivor, struggle, success, who has done something unbelievable, those who have break the wall of barrier, faced challenges of life, and done something commendable and become the inspiration for others. Those who are victim, faced challenges, it can be social taboo such as dowry, casteism, gender discrimination or it can be survivor from the deadliest disease, it can be a social activist, it can be a someone who fought and succeed to come out from drug or any kind of addiction. Anyone, who has a unique story which helps readers to understand life\'s way of living, the cause of happenings, have an impact on readers attitude and who has a story to tell to make a difference to readers can be a human book.\nQualities which a human book should have are:\nThey should be honest while sharing their stories and representing their titles.\nFirstly, the book should understand the reason for his choice by the readers.\nBook should be prepared for the repeated answers as the different readers may put the same questions. The stories will help readers to take their life\'s decision; therefore the stories should be true and not be influenced by any kind of situation.\nThe book should be expressive of their title.\nBook should only be focus on sharing his story to readers and careful in giving advice.\nThe conversation between the book and the reader should be confidential.\nThe book should not get into another role or another character, he should be himself only.\nThe book should be maintaining confidentiality while referring to person identity.\nThe content of the book should be clearly expressive to readers.\nThe book should end conversation within a limited time provided.\nMETHODOLOGY FOR HUMAN LIBRARY EVENT\nHuman Library is an event based, it don\'t has four wall of physical existence, human library has a human books or living books, human library is place where living books are interact with readers and share their true stories. The steps involved in organizing a human library event are: Firstly, the people who want to be a human book should have a unique story.\nThe committee will listen the story and will decide that whether the story of a person can become the title of a book or not.\nThe librarian will show the readers the catalogue with the living books, let readers to know all the title of a human book which are available and consult them their choice of their best book.\nThe reader will decide which book they want to read.\nThe reader will fill up the borrower form, mentioning the title of the book, time of issue and return. The reader will be issued the human book which they have asked.\nThe Librarian will guide the reader towards the place he can find the book.\nThe Human book and reader spend together time as allotted for sharing the story and conversation.\nIf the book and reader requires more time he can ask librarian to renew the loan.\nAfter, completing conversation the reader should go to the returning desk to return the book and complete necessary formalities.\nAt the end of the library experience both the readers and books are provided the feedback form to write about their experiences.\nTACIT KNOWLEDGE BECOMES EXPLICIT KNOWLEDGE\nIn the field of knowledge management, the concept of tacit knowledge refers to a knowledge which cannot be fully codified. Human Library is a platform where the tacit knowledge of the human becomes the explicit knowledge through meaningful conversation between the living books and the readers. Although, the tacit knowledge is more difficult to externalize and share but some extent it can be expressive through interactive conversation rather than in writing form. Therefore, human library provides opportunity to share tacit knowledge of human books to readers.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHuman Library becomes a platform for sharing the real stories of life from the real people and real time conversation. As, the book gives knowledge to readers about subject the human book gives knowledge to readers about their real life experience and happenings. Stories of human book help readers to take their life\'s decision. There is a direct conversation between the reader and the books therefore, it will be more effective and have an impact on reader\'s attitude. The human library event can also become a cause of social activism as it is a platform for sharing the real stories by the victims. The event should be organized regularly, as it not only change the people\'s perception but also lead to the positive social change.",1351,1434

Each of these books volunteers to participate in the library and share their stories. Like a normal library, the human library has a book jacket and description, and a ""reader"" can check ""books"" on a topic that he / she / they are interested in learning more about.The Human Library was created in the spring of 2000 in Copenhagen by Ronnie Abergal and his brother Danny and colleagues Asma Mauna and Christopher Erichsen. The original event was open eight hours a day for four days and covered more than fifty different topics. The wide selection of books gave readers enough choice to challenge their stereotypes, so more than a thousand readers benefited and the books, librarians, organizers and readers were amazed at the acceptance and impact of the human library""(Human Library Organization, 2020). Through the concept of human libraries are able to positively change people\'s attitudes, thoughts, perceptions and behaviors, and thereby create a respectful conversation. Instead of examining and judging a book from its cover like in a traditional library, we will be able to connect with a person who has stories with unique life experiences and we can chat with them for free.\nIt has been nearly 20 years since the concept of the human library was introduced. The concept of human libraries has spread far and wide in foreign countries, and the results have shown that these countries have reached the pinnacle of development.According to Johannes, the library is an innovative way of promoting dialogue, reducing prejudice and encouraging understanding. Following this rationale, human library access has been promoted in other countries and followed in various fields. Alport also suggests that positive relationships between groups can reduce negative prejudice. He also points out that the human library approach focuses on facilitating inter-group relationships, and that it is a good way to intervene as a remedy for mental health malpractice.\nThe human library is the key that can be used to successfully socialize people with mental illness (Kwan,2020).\nHe goes on to say that human library access can be introduced as a community intervention strategy to facilitate optimal socialization of people with mental illness( in recovery ).\nToday, the number of suicides and mental illnesses in Sri Lanka has increased dramatically. According to a report released by the World Health Organization in 2012, Sri Lanka has the third highest number of suicides.\nBut in the 30 years between 1985 and 2015, Wikipedia ranked Sri Lanka 7th out of 107 countries in terms of the number of suicides in the world. About one million people commit suicide each year, and by 2020 it is estimated to be 1.5 million. According to the Registrar General\'s Department, about 4,000 Sri Lankans commit suicide each year (World Health Organization,2020)Possibility through programs. Therefore, it is very important to implement human library programs in third world countries such as Sri Lanka. Libraries can also do a great job of talking about their problems and motivating them with positive ideas. The importance of applying the concept of human library to the library system in Sri Lanka is immense. However, the spread of the human library concept in the library system in Sri Lanka is still slow and it is safe to say that the programs that are currently being implemented are not functioning successfully and are problematic.\nObjectives\nThe main objective of this research was to study the importance of applying the concept of human library to the library system of Sri Lanka through the Colombo University Library, Sri Jayewardenepura University Library, Athurugiriya Public Library and the National Library. The other objective is to identify the current status of human libraries currently operating in Sri Lanka, identify strategies used in the implementation of human library programs, and identify issues and challenges faced by librarians and staff in implementing human library programs.\nMethodology\nThe survey method was used as the research method. University libraries and public libraries in Sri Lanka as population. For sample, University of Colombo Library, University of Sri Jayewardenepura Library and Athurugiriya Public Library and National Library have been selected for a total of 100 readers, each with 25 readers and the librarians and staff have been selected for a total of 25 each 5 librarians and staff. Primary data was collected from a questionnaire. University Grants Commission, Department of Census and Statistics, Annual Reports and Statistics of the respective Universities for obtaining secondary data Records were used.\nResults and Discussion\nIt was revealed that the concept of human library has not spread properly in the library system of Sri Lanka. It was also revealed that library programs in the University of Colombo Library, Sri Jayewardenepura University Library, Athurugiriya Public Library and the National Library in Sri Lanka are not functioning successfully at present. Many librarians implement human library programs confined to a traditional framework. Most readers prefer to communicate with a live person instead of reading books\nConclusion and Recommendations\nMany benefits can be gained by applying the concept of human library to the library system in Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, human library programs operate in only a limited number of libraries. There is also inefficiency in the human library programs that are currently being implemented. The competent authorities should pay attention to this and further promote human library programs.The concept of human libraries in Sri Lanka has spread slowly. It is limited to the National Library, the University Library of Colombo and the University of Jayewardenepura and several public libraries. Today, the concept has spread to more than 80 countries. But the concept of human libraries has spread in Sri Lanka at a very slow pace. That is, the concept of human libraries has spread to a very limited number of libraries.\nHuman library programs need to be further expanded within the library system of Sri Lanka. Competent authorities should pay attention to its expansion in the library system in foreign countries as well as in Sri Lanka. Every librarian as well as staff should be informed and given proper training to implement the human library concept. Human library programs should be organized involving all parties from young to old.\nPrograms should be promoted using appropriate media to educate users about upcoming human library programs. Curriculum should be developed on this human library concept.",1255,1391

What are these skills? According to Clayton, et al. ( 2003 ), they include expertise in fundamental areas such as people-related skills, conceptual/thinking skills, personal skills, skills related to the business world, and skills related to the community. Many have concluded that traditional academic educational techniques alone cannot enhance such skills to the fullest, and that institutions of higher education need to include other approaches to learning in what they offer to their students in terms of teaching.\nOne important alternative methodology is active learning. This has been promoted as a practice that goes beyond traditional pedagogies such as the banking concept of education whereby the teacher transmits knowledge to students to guide them toward an instructional goal ( Freire, 1972( Freire, , 1999 ) ). The aims and techniques of active learning differ markedly from this approach. Its goal is to enhance studentsÊ¼ perceptive, ethical, social, educational, cognitive, and experiential competencies-in other words, their generic skills (Monbu-kagaku-sho, 2012). Some have sought to trace the lineage of this pedagogy back to the work of Vygotsky (1978) and Piaget (1983), in whose writings they discern the belief that studentsÊ¼ learning occurs through communication and interaction with their teacher and classmates in the context of purposeful activities such as group work, presentations, and discussion, which can of course be based on more traditional activities like academic research. Whatever its lineage, it cannot be denied that the central feature of the active learning approach is that it is process oriented rather than goal oriented.\nIn such a context, the role of the teacher undergoes a subtle redefinition, and the need for new instructional skills becomes apparent. Perhaps the most important ones here are mentoring skills, which are necessarily rather more wide-ranging than those required by conventional teaching. True mentoring is "" a complex process that supports a mutual enhancement of independent and critically reflective thinking "" ( Galbraith, 2003, p. 9 ), so rather than merely giving advice, mentoring aims to enhance not only the total teaching and learning process, but also to create a supportive and open academic climate (Galbraith, 2003). Since the aim of mentors is to support, guide and provide counsel to the less experienced to facilitate their careers (Kram, 1988), there is no single template for them to follow; mentoring relationships in fact vary considerably in context and communication style.\nAccording to the definition offered by Zelditch ( 1990 ), mentors can combine a variety of roles, including those of: advisors, people with career experience willing to share their knowledge; supporters, who can give emotional and moral encouragement; tutors, who can give specific feedback on a studentÊ¼s performance; masters, in the sense of an employer to whom the student is apprenticed; sponsors, sources of information about and aid in obtaining opportunities; and role models, demonstrating by example the kind of person an academic should aspire to become.\nOf all the opportunities for learning available in institutions of higher education, it is perhaps the seminar that offers the most favorable conditions for the development of studentsÊ¼ generic skills through active learning and the presence of a mentor. It is for this reason that I began to experiment with these approaches and decided to use the Human Library project as a means to enhance the generic skills of my seminar students. This paper describes the implementation of that project and assesses the degree of success that it enjoyed based on the following research question; in what ways the studentsÊ¼ generic skills were enhanced through active learning and mentoring during Human Library project.\nRJISï¼»Vol. 24, 2016ï¼½\nDeveloping Generic Skills, Active Learning and Mentoring in an Undergraduate Seminar\nAt my university in suburban Tokyo, students entering the third year of their four-year program are encouraged to choose a seminar course that lasts for two entire academic years. The format of the seminar is not like that of other content courses in which students spend their time listening to lectures, making notes and taking exams in a large classroom. Instead, a small group, ranging from six to twelve in number, works closely together for their final two undergraduate years.\nThis allows for a much interactive environment in which students can create deeper and warmer relationships with their peers as well as with the teacher offering the seminar.\nOver the course of the first three years that I conducted such a seminar, the feeling grew in me that my studentsÊ¼ generic skills were not improving as much as I wished, and I was also aware that the atmosphere of the group was not as collaborative as it could have been. I gradually realized that my approach was lacking in certain ways. I had begun by using traditional methods in structuring the seminar: third year students were encouraged to read textbooks, write up their findings and present them to the group; then, in the fourth year, they each decided on their own topic for research and wrote a thesis on it. Those with experience of guiding students in such enterprises will know that not all of them are equally enthusiastic about the process of writing a thesis, and that these days a supervisor has to be aware of challenges posed by the internet, such as exactly where and how the line between proper citation and plagiarism needs to be drawn. Unless one is very careful, such issues can make the teacher-students relationship a somewhat dry and distant one.\nIt also began to be clear to me that for a number of my students, the enhancing of their generic skills was at least as important to them as acquiring research and thesis writing competencies, since their proximate goal was not a postgraduate degree, but a career in business. I therefore began to search for activities that would give greater scope for the development of their generic skills, especially relational skills that would increase their capacity to form and sustain collaborative and healthy human relationships (a bonus here being that success would help to alter the atmosphere of the seminar itself). At the same time, I was aware that this turn towards active learning would make new demands on me, in particular pushing me to acquire the mentoring skills that are indispensible to the creation of a genuinely interactive and collaborative learning environment. However, first, I needed to settle on a particular active learning project, and in due course I decided to experiment with the Human Library to see whether it would meet the needs of my students.\nEnhancing StudentsÊ¼ Generic Skills through Active Learning and Mentoring\nThe Nature and Advantages of the Human Library as an Active Learning Project\nThe concept the Human Library (HL) originated in Denmark in 2000 and has since spread to more than 60 countries (Tsuboi, 2012). Its essence is to provide a space for dialogue between a Living Book ( a teller, drawn from the local community), and a Borrower who ""reads"" the Living Book. In selecting the Living Books to be borrowed, the project had the broad aims of reducing prejudice and encouraging mutual understanding between people by combating stereotypical, prejudiced views about age, sex and cultural background.\nOne of the HLÊ¼s principal attractions for me was that it could be organized and implemented by the students themselves, allowing them to take center stage as active learners and leaving me free to focus on the development of their generic skills by taking on the various roles of a mentor described above. The students were to be in charge of the whole project from the planning stages onwards, conducting it themselves and then reflecting on it. They would act as Librarians in seeking out and selecting people willing to act as Living Books by asking them to recount their life experiences. They would then ask them to write out synopses of their stories, being mindful not to cause mental hurt to the Living Books in the process of getting them to disclose their personal stories. The students Ê¼ entire experience of working as a team to coordinate the project, together with their individual experiences of interacting with the Living Books, allowed them to create quality collaborative relationships both among themselves and with others outside the group. It was, therefore, hoped that they would have multiple opportunities to develop generic skills, particularly relational ones.\nThe Preparatory Stage of the Human Library Project: The Role of Mentoring\nFor these reasons I decided to begin working with a group of six third year students (four female and two male) on a trial HL project. This was a test not only for the students, but also for me; during the months when the students were preparing all that was needed for the main HL event in July 2015, as mentor I had to learn to play the various roles noted above, those of advisor, supporter, tutor, master, sponsor, and role model.\nAs an advisor, I used my own career experience to share with the students my understanding of the essential nature of teamwork and leadership. I always had them work as a team and emphasized the importance of reporting and consulting with all its members. I also hosted small parties outside the classroom for team building purposes, and it was noticeable how after every one of these, the team members became closer to one another, which made cooperation between them\nRJISï¼»Vol. 24, 2016ï¼½\neasier. The stronger the bonds between them became, the more deeply they were able to learn from one another. I also advised individual students on the kind of leadership roles that they could take on, again based on my own career experience (see section 6-4 below).\nAs a supporter, I tried to give as much emotional and moral encouragement to the students as possible, both when we met and when communicating by email or via LINE. Frequent feedback of this kind is important to create and sustain motivation, so I took every chance to comment on their reflection notes, for example, using these opportunities to acknowledge their uniqueness, and individual talents and skills. This helped the students select the particular role for which they were best suited, making them more aware of their unique talents that could be used to make the group work more creatively.\nAs a tutor, I taught them how to write appropriate emails to the Living Books. I first provided them with a sample message that they could use as a template, and then gave specific feedback on the draft messages that they produced themselves before these were sent to the Living Books. Once the process of communication had begun, I kept an eye on it and gave further advice when needed, taking care to praise the studentsÊ¼ efforts and making my comments as positive as possible when editing their writing.\nAs a sponsor, I acted to provide sources of information about the project and helped them gain opportunities to prepare themselves to run it effectively. Thus to enhance their understanding of the HL concept by showing them a concrete example of it, I accompanied them to an HL event organized by an NPO on 11 April,\n2015.\nBy observing and then reflecting on their feelings about this experience as a group over dinner after the event, they began to see their path more clearly. It as the first time they had ever been to such a meeting and they were all very nervous beforehand, but I knew it was vital for them so I just went ahead with it.\nI tried to be a good role model by providing an academic environment in which the students could move from theory to practice and back again throughout the project. To achieve such an outcome, the teacher-student relationship needs to be ""power-with"" rather than ""power-over."" In a reflection note, I reminded myself of my own experience of taking an online course in the U. S., which had taught me how positive messages from an instructor had motivated me as a student to keep working in a distance learning environment, something that is just as necessary when contact is face-to-face.\nAs mentor, I constantly monitored both myself and the students to assess the and two staff members from the college who volunteered to help them, my seminar students acted not only as Librarians responsible for the smooth running of the HL event, but also as Borrowers who listened to each of the Living Books. As\nLibrarians, the students carried out the following tasks: organizing an orientation session with the Living Books; preparing the space for the HL; manning the reception area; doing the time-keeping, one session being limited to 30 minutes;\nsetting up the lunch tables and providing lunch boxes and drinks; guiding the participants, and so on.\nThe Living Books and those from outside attending the event judged it to have been a success. The Borrowers were asked to complete a questionnaire before leaving. One of them said, ""The thirty minutes went by so fast. I definitely want to come again,"" while another noted that ""It was very nice to meet people whom I had never thought about meeting before and to listen to their stories,"" while a third reported, ""I was encouraged to overcome any difficulties by listening to the Living Book."" The Librarians (students) and I also had scheduled a lunch meeting with the Living Books and this provided a good opportunity to mingle and exchange thoughts and reflections on the morning session; then, after the entire event was over, we got together for another reflection session. The Living Books themselves were very positive about the event. One remarked, ""It was fun getting to know the students. I wanted to talk more with them,"" while a second said, ""At the beginning, I was nervous, but during the second session, I found that I could in fact tell people what I wanted to pass on to them.""\nOf course, given that this was the first time that we had trialed a HL event, not everything went smoothly, and the reflection sessions helped us to identify areas for improvement next time. For example, some participants needed more in the way of explanation about the event, so we should have provided an extra Librarian at the helpdesk in order to help them understand the concept of HL event more easily.\nAlso, since some sessions did not attract any Borrowers, we matched up two Living Books who collaborated to improvise a dialogue on a topic of relevance to both of them, such as learning how to live with particular challenges. In spite of such blemishes, though, there were plenty of reasons for saying that, overall, the event itself had been a success.\nWhile the event can be judged to have been valuable in its own right and the response to it pleasing, the underlying rationale of the exercise was in fact to improve the generic skills of the students who organized it and my own performance as mentor, and we must now turn to evaluating whether or not the project achieved these central goals.\nEvaluating the Human Library Project: Data Collection and Analysis\nWhen assessing changes in generic skills, it is helpful to utilize the theoretical framework provided by Relational Cultural Theory (RCT), which was developed in the 1980s by Jean Baker Miller and her colleagues in a therapeutic context (Schwartz, 2013). RCT focuses on five key elements (increased energy, self-esteem, self-awareness, ability to take action, and desire for further connection ), that it considers essential if individuals are to initiate and sustain healthy relationships.\nThese elements are often referred to as ""The Five Good Things"" (Jordan, 2010;Miller & Stiver, 1997) and they make RCT a very useful theory for highlighting the techniques that can help students to enhance their generic skills and so serve society better with mindsets attuned to accepting diversity and forming healthy relationships with people from different cultural backgrounds. The Five Good Things"" (Jordan, 2010;Miller & Stiver, 1997) and the findings for each of these are now presented in sequence.\n6-1. StudentsÊ¼ energy\nMeeting new people ( especially the Living Books ) and working with other members of the seminar as part of a team certainly had an enlivening effect on the students. At the HL event in particular, they were motivated and inspired by listening to the Living Books, checking them out themselves and listening to a variety of stories about intractable diseases, gender identity disorder, gambling dependency, mental illnesses, and so on. Learning about the lives of the Living Books had a huge and energizing impact on them.\nThis impact was noticeable not just in increased mindfulness but also in an access of creativity; the students themselves took the initiative in creating a Facebook page to advertise the HL event on July 14, 2015, and they also publicized it via the Social Network Service (SNS) to bring it to the attention of individuals and organizations that might have been interested in it. Communication between group members was also livelier throughout the project; the students created a more cohesive and inclusive atmosphere by sending encouraging words or cute\nRJISï¼»Vol. 24, 2016ï¼½\nemoticons on LINE to one another. Given the many other demands on them, they could not all devote their time and effort to the project fully, but when they felt they were perhaps not doing enough, they checked on one another via LINE and tried to make up for their diminished involvement by supporting and helping others in their tasks. Thus, increased energy levels helped them to develop healthier relationships.\n6-2. Self-esteem\nConducting the HL project clearly enhanced the students Ê¼ self-esteem, as reflected in their rising levels of confidence in themselves. At the HL itself, I witnessed this happening as they interacted with the Living Books and staff members. They betrayed an initial nervousness when meeting new people, especially Living Books like the hostess of a gay bar who came from backgrounds they had never previously encountered, or had even thought of encountering. But they gradually relaxed and some of their reflection notes indicated how they had enjoyed the experience and now felt it would be easier than before for them to interact when meeting people for the first time.\nThe students also gained confidence through making presentations to others.\nOn the first occasion they met each of the Living Books, they made a presentation to explain the purpose of the HL project to them. They also presented with me at an academic conference called, SIETAR (Society for Intercultural Education) Japan.\nOne student wrote in a reflection note about how ""We improved our presentation skills by presenting together,"" while another commented that ""We always work together. It helps to reduce the distance between us."" Their collaborative work helped one another to gain their generic skills, too.\nAnother crucial change occurred as they learned how to write email messages in the appropriate manner by using honorific terms. Japanese culture is rather formal and hierarchical, and people are expected to write to one another in an appropriate manner, paying special regard to whether the other person is senior in age or status, or is a guest, when making initial contact. Generally speaking, students are not sufficiently well trained to be able to write in the correct manner and so may unwittingly give offence to the recipients of their emails. When this is revealed, a studentÊ¼s self-esteem can suffer.\nImproving the students Ê¼ writing skills certainly helped to boost their self-esteem. As one student wrote in a reflection note, ""I gained team work, positive attitude and manner of speaking and writing toward older people through the HL project. "" But it would also, of course, be beneficial to them in terms of future job-hunting; recruiters evaluate positively those students who can talk and write in the appropriate manner and form.\n6-3. Self-awareness\nStudents certainly gained greater self-awareness as a result of participating in Enhancing StudentsÊ¼ Generic Skills through Active Learning and Mentoring the project. One of them in particular made considerable progress here. At the beginning of the project he was something of a passenger in the group, not taking on any role and not even replying to messages from other group members, including myself. This was frustrating, but we tried not to react negatively to his attitude, acting mindfully instead by continuing to email or send him messages on LINE. Whenever he still did not reply, I talked with him in person, and this gradually had an effect. He began to build positive relationships with his team members and started to work better. He acknowledged that he had not made much of a contribution at first, but became more aware of his attitude and changed it as a result of support from his fellow team members. His reserved personality meant that he preferred to avoid taking risks; however, he was responsible for working with a Living Book who had had ptosis from birth, and who told him that it was a gift from heaven. This had a big impact on the student, and he learned something about the importance of liking himself and being confident, which changed his frame of reference and allowed him to become more positive about himself. He wrote in his final report that he had become better able to understand himself over the course of the project. Another student also shared with me how he had changed his frame of reference in respect of homosexuality by listening to a Living Book. He told me that he noticed his own prejudice on the subject, and this experience had made him more objectively aware of his frame of reference. At the same time, he learned the importance of discovering diversity in society.\nFor students to increase their self-awareness and change their frames of reference, self-reflection is necessary. Frequent feedback from me on their reflection notes helped them to think again about what they had experienced while working as a team. I also assigned a final written report in which they had to reflect on their own performance, on the way the team had worked, on what they had gone well and what had not, and what they had learned from the project. I also asked them to evaluate and write positive assessments of the other members of the team.\n6-4. Ability to take action\nOne student wrote in her final report that she learned how to take a leadership role by showing consideration for other team members. This student was very responsible and efficient; every time we had a meeting, for example, she wrote up the minutes and sent them to me the same day. She was definitely a leader in the group, but was too reserved and needed some encouragement to take on an overtly leadership role. We talked about how she might become more comfortable about doing this, and I outlined some different leadership styles. She said that she could best take on a leadership role by asking her team members if there was anything she could do to help, rather than becoming a recognized director of the team. In other words, she was most comfortable leading the group from behind.\nOther students also made contributions to the team by finding suitable Living\nRJISï¼»Vol. 24, 2016ï¼½\nBooks. This was the hardest part of the project, but they took the initiative in asking around and found some people willing to taking on the role of a Living Book. By advertising the HL event and in particular by creating a Facebook page, as noted above, they attracted a response; one Living Book volunteered after viewing the Facebook page. He was the one of the first Living Books in Japan and so was able to give us much useful advice about running the event. The students also created posters and delivered 1000 fliers in the neighborhood of the college. Observing them in action demonstrating their autonomy and taking risks was very pleasing.\n6-5. Desire for further connection\nThrough the project, the students demonstrated an enhanced desire for further connection as a result of their involvement. Both orally and in their final written report they let me know that they were now more willing to connect with strangers to broaden their worldview. For example, one student wrote that the HL could serve as a beginning for solving many other problems including school violence, aging issues, and dependence/addiction issues, since listening to other people in this way was a very powerful incentive for change. One commented as follows:\nIn order to learn from people from different cultural backgrounds, we need to talk in person. It is important to see their facial expressions and discern what they are thinking. The HL allows us to do that. If I had not experienced the HL, I am sure that I would never have felt like this.\nThe Living BooksÊ¼ courageous attitude in facing reality made a huge impact on the students, and stimulated them to talk more freely about themselves; after the event, one student told me about his own experience of having intractable disease, while another reflected on her experience of working with her Living Book as a partner and said, "" I want my Living Book partner to know about me; it is not enough that I only got to know about her.""\nThe students were also clearly proud of having provided this opportunity for the benefit of the community and were enthusiastic about continuing the HL program into the future to sustain the links between the college and the community. The HL project also stimulated their desire for further connection by providing multiple opportunities for communication, both via the internet and LINE, and face-to-face when reporting to, and consulting with, the group. The whole process helped the students to enhance their generic skills and this also stimulated their desire for further connection.\nLimitations of the Study\nThe major issue here concerns the dual role that I played in this project as mentor and as researcher. Switching between these is not easy, and it could have \nImplications for the Future Research\nIn order to enhance studentsÊ¼ generic skills, especially their relational skills, the differences between how a teacher mentor students and how students mentors other students need to be investigated to promote more effective student learning.\nIf future research demonstrates that student-student mentoring is more effective than teacher-student mentoring, I will need to train students to act as mentors for the next generation of students in my seminar class as we carry the HL project forward.\nConclusion\nActive learning, especially project based learning, is not easy to facilitate, but it is effective in enhancing studentsÊ¼ generic skills, especially the relational skills that are vital in fostering collaborative and healthy human relationships. The experience of mentoring students during the HL project taught me a great deal more than I had expected; in fact my students acted, albeit unwittingly, as my teachers, which was very rewarding. Learning is only really possible when people are connected, and the closer such connections, the better the quality of the learning. For the students, the whole experience brought about very considerable changes in their outlook, and it is also safe to conclude that the HL project clearly resulted in the enhancement of their generic skills, and particularly the relational skills that are essential for global citizenship and leadership.",5437,5872
,https://pjiml.pu.edu.pk/jo/index.php/pjiml/article/view/63,Yap et al 2017,True,Yap,"Defining, Understanding and Promoting Cultural Diversity Through the Human Library Program",,2017,,,"INTRODUCTION\nLibraries create programs to provide alternative learning experiences to its diverse users. Libraries become a space for participation, collaboration and knowledge dissemination. De La Salle University (DLSU) Libraries are committed to support the learning needs of the users by providing a wide-array of programs. For instance, the Libraries adopted the Human Library to challenge stereotypes, stigma, prejudice and discrimination among diverse group of people. The human library was able to attract hundreds of readers from all walks of life and has conducted at least ten sessions since 2014. The human library program is properly documented and it tries to reach out to the public by producing an online platform where human books may be viewed and watched online. Since 2016, selected videos were uploaded via YouTube, an online video sharing tool.\nAs the DLSU Libraries continue to provide alternative ways of sharing factual and evidence-based information, how can they best assist the public aside from the academic community they serve? What technological trend is already available and free for use by the general public for them to access the collection of the library? With the adoption of an online video sharing tool, the propagation of knowledge becomes fast and efficient for those who want to retrieve information as conveniently as possible. The paper seeks to explore how effective an online video sharing tool is as a primary source of media and information literacy resource, considering that the human library program would want to get a wide reach of viewers (readers) especially to those who were not able to attend the live/actual activity. Furthermore, the paper will provide its readers insight into the status of human library programs in the Philippines.\nBACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nLiteracies\nThe Philippines is an archipelago with an approximate number of 7,500 islands as conveyed by the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA). The geographic area is composed of straits, seas and mountain ranges. The country has total land area of 30 million hectares (De Vera, 2007). In August 2015, there are 100.98 million Filipinos. Ethnolinguistic groups are also present in the entire nation. There are 110 major indigenous groups across the Philippines, and each one has its own traditions and culture. The National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) presents a comprehensive list of them. Peralta (2015) also provided all the ethnic boundaries and numerous aspects of the ethnic groups in his online book entitled, ""Glimpses: Peoples of the Philippines.""\nFunctional literacy rate was 86.4% as of 2008 (PSA, 2014) and 90.3% in 2013(PSA, 2015). Meanwhile, the Functional Literacy, Education and Mass Media Survey (FLEMMS) data is different from the previous statistics stated above although it came from the same parent institution. FLEMMS recorded a 95.6% functional (Lee, 2015). However, functional literacy does not suffice the necessities in understanding a more complex situation especially when the individual requires providing a reliable and credible source of information. Functional literacy may have increased, but, the way people use and interpret the information is questionable. The reading habits of the citizens have declined primarily due to economic reasons and perhaps the attitude of people towards reading. The National Book Development Board (NBDB) recorded a slight decrease of Filipino adult readers in 2012 (NBDB, 2012). From 92% in 2007 it became 88% in 2012. In Philippine libraries, information literacy programs have been established. For instance, the De La Salle University Library has been offering information literacy (IL) courses since the 1970\'s (Valerio, 2009). Consequently, there is the emerging concept of media and information literacy (MIL) where libraries need to adopt and develop.\nCultural Diversity\nThe Philippines is embodied by many cultures, and hence, one can say that it is a good example of a very diverse nation. With its rich and colorful history, the Philippines is a place for more than a hundred indigenous tribes. The long presence and influence of the Spaniards as well as the Americans, Japanese and Chinese made the country a multi-cultural state. Such diverse culture sometimes leads to misunderstanding between groups. Each group has their own way of life cultural practices. To avoid misinterpretation among cultural groups, citizens have the right to be fully informed about the various customs and traditions which may be taught in school.\nMIL in the Philippines\nMedia and Information Literacy (MIL) is a concept that refers to the essential competencies (i.e. knowledge, skills and attitude) that allow citizens to engage with media and other information providers effectively and develop critical thinking and lifelong-learning skills for socializing and becoming active citizens (UNESCO, 2011). Currently, MIL in the Philippines is still being discussed. With the introduction of K-12 in the country, the Department of Education has included MIL as a core subject in the curriculum of grades 11 and 12. The Enhanced Basic Education Act (also called Republic Act 10533) passed into law in 2013 which adds two years of senior high school education. The Senior High School started its implementation in 2016. Textbooks are already available; however, the content is more inclined in media literacy rather than media and information literacy. Some books also forgot to\ninclude the important aspects of information literacy. MIL truly happens if people know how to seek and find reliable media and information, manage media and information and create a systematic way of organizing it, evaluate the sources critically, cite media and information sources correctly and demonstrate ways on how to treat media and information ethically.\nTo institutionalize MIL in the country, the Asian Institute of Journalism and Communication (AIJC) is spearheading a national consultation towards Philippines MIL policies and strategies. This is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) project. A background paper is being developed and stakeholders are being consulted to come-up with an output of creating a policy brief on MIL policies in the Philippines.\nSeminars are also available for librarians to keep them abreast about the status of MIL. The latest was conducted in July 2016 by the Philippine Normal University Library and Information Science Alumni Association (PNULISAA). They organized a half-day forum on ""Teacher-Librarian Collaboration: Developing Meta-literate Learners in a K-12 Environment (Media and Information Literacy)"".\nLITERATURE REVIEW\nHuman Library is an innovative method that leads to the reduction of prejudice, encourages understanding and promotes dialogue (Zhai, Zhao & Wang, 2012). As Yap &Labangon (2015) discussed, human library is an alternative way of learning for both the reader and the human book which eventually creates a liberating moment for both parties as they share their experiences. It empowers people to accept the differences among individuals. Moreover, human libraries promote good values by hearing unheard stories appreciate stigmatized groups of people (Rhodes, 2016). This program promotes social cohesion to address the discrimination in the society (Watson, 2015). By participating in this kind of event, people widen their understanding about the other people, strengthen their life skills and are able to build good relationship with one another (Pope, 2013).\nEvents such as this start with creating a committee that will handle the activity and then the committee decides on how to recruit books (Wentz, 2013). Human Library events need a good collection development strategy (Granger, 2017). An organizer should be able to conduct a survey to its users about their perceived prejudices among groups of people. Organizers must carefully select their human books protecting not only their reputation but also the groups they represent. Human books are cataloged and readers may pre-select human books PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT & LIBRARIES (PJIM&L) 5 https://doi.org/10.47657%2F2017191012 before the actual event. A human library encourages individuals to check-out real humans to share stories and engage conversations (Dobreski& Huang, 2016). Since human libraries addresses racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination, it is not only libraries that hold this kind of program. Even art galleries as a venue to promote cultural dialogue can be a perfect venue. Clover and Dogus ( 2014) have written about their human library experience combining both dialogue and exhibit. Towards the end, human libraries create an environment of discussion and interaction and are geared towards benefitting both the book and the reader into a learning process that is reflective and active (Gamtso, Mannon& Whipple, 2017).\nMETHODOLOGY\nThis paper used a survey method using a print questionnaire to gather insights from the human books and readers. The responses were gathered, encoded and tabulated using an online tool (i.e. Google forms and spreadsheet) to analyze the results. Each time a session is finished, the person-incharge of the program encoded the responses in the online form. The print copies were preserved for verification purposes. For the evaluation part of human books and readers, only the first five human library sessions were included in this study.\nThe videos uploaded were also analyzed using the built-in analytics of YouTube. Since 2016, a total of 29 videos were uploaded in the Libraries\' YouTube account with clips ranging from seven minutes to videos with more than one hour of running time. Using the built-in analytics of YouTube, each video was examined based on the number of likes, shares and views. The results provided the average number of likes, shares and views of all the uploaded videos from October 2016 to January 2017. The Human Library program has been described and an evaluation of the readers has also presented and discussed. For the purpose of analyzing the uploaded videos, the study included the sessions recorded from session one to six.\nFINDINGS & DISCUSSION\n\nMIL at De La Salle University\nDe La Salle University (DLSU) Libraries have always been at the forefront of providing user education programs to its patrons. MIL programs help the library patrons become independent and lifelong learners. Furthermore, a relevant and important program called \'The Human Library\' was also introduced in 2014 to challenge certain stereotype, stigma, prejudice and discrimination (DLSU Newsette, 2014). This paper will focus more on the human library as form of oral history, as an avenue of corporate social responsibility and as a program that leads to social transformation. The United Nations proposed 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) which included two goals that our program can fully support. These are goal number 4 -Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all and goal number 5 -Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls (Singh, Grizzle, Yee & Culver, 2015).\nThe human library. Since its inception in 2014 as part of the programs of DLSU Libraries, the Human Library had a total of ten sessions. Human Library aims to create a venue where users can find diverse forms of information (Yap & Labangon, 2015). It surpasses social obstructions of inequality and discrimination. Currently, it has been adopted by many libraries and social groups globally.\nHuman library sessions consist of human books and readers. Human books are people that are subjected to stereotyping and present themselves as representatives of the marginalized groups. Human Book volunteer must be selected carefully to justifiably signify the group they are representing. They should also be properly oriented to prepare themselves in maintaining such intriguing yet sometimes challenging dialogues (Watson, 2015).\nFor those who intend to understand the relationship between human book and readers -it is basically to create dialogue with each other. Readers in the human library session may literally ask unscripted questions to clarify things based on their views on the subject of the human book. They can personally ask questions and learn from a different perspective. As stated by Yap and Labangon (2015), ""the dialogue has no structure, making each loan period a unique one. It is important, however, that the readers are appropriately briefed PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT & LIBRARIES (PJIM&L) 7 https://doi.org/10.47657%2F2017191012 about the activity so as to enable them to find a common ground during the interaction."" Celebrating diversity is a key aspect of every Human Library it was indicated that ""the Human Library [acts] as a bridge between people of different backgrounds"" (Yap &Labangon, 2015) Kudo et al. (2011) assert that it creates a powerful instrument that cultivates our capability to act on differences. DLSU human library. Human library sessions are free and open to the public. Everyone is encouraged to participate and join. The Committee advertised and invited participants through all kinds of media -through online radio, print newspapers, posters and social media. The organizer also tapped and partnered with other DLSU offices and student organizations including the alumni. Some sessions also combined exhibitions organized by a separate committee in partnership with the public programs librarian.\nThe sessions were video recorded. Human books were asked to sign a waiver form. Human books were asked if they are willing to be volunteers as they are not going to receive any monetary amount from the organizers. As a volunteer, they were asked if they agree to be photographed or documented through video recording.\nOne problem the committee encountered was the lack of available video camera. Therefore, only selected human books were being video recorded to capture their stories. This type of video recording may also be categorized as a new and evolving nature of oral history captured in video. Oral histories are considered primary sources of information (Starr, 1996). They capture and preserve life events by recording autobiographies through sound and video. If appropriately examined, oral histories can be good sources of oral documentation. Delivering sociallydesirable results make human libraries a socially relevant activity. An academic library acts as an entity that is innovative and at the same time transforms its readers to be sensitive to any form of prejudice, stereotyping, discrimination or bias (Yap &Labangon, 2015). This is DLSU Library\'s own way of serving the people with pure and unbiased intentions. This is their way of being a corporate social responsible institution.\nVideo recordings are the end product of the activity. This is the only replay that the organizers can offer after every session. The videos undergo simple editing and are cataloged. Videos become part of the library collection and may be loaned out to the library users especially those who were not able to attend the sessions. The stories of the human books do not end after the session. It needs to be shared\nto the greater public so that people may understand their struggles in life. This is our way of educating people about the uniqueness of every person. Each one of us has our own differences and similarities. We should stop discriminating individuals or groups just because we can\'t identify ourselves with them. This is our way of transforming lives. This is our share of making everybody media and information literate by re-packaging sources of information and making it widely accessible.\nSummary of the human books. Our human books vary with every session and we strive to provide a diverse selection to our readers. In the course of our implementation of this program, we have classified the prejudices in the following:\n1) Physical traits. e.g. person with tattoo, overweight, underweight; person with physical deformities, blind, midget; 2) Gender preference. e.g. lesbian, gays, bisexual and transgender; 3) Profession. e.g. politician, policeman, banker, businesswoman, columnist, fitness teacher, lingerie model, young entrepreneur; 4) Religious belief/practice.e.g. atheist, Buddhist monk, Muslim, nun; 5) Afflicted with disease. e.g. person living with HIV; 6) Distinct character.e.g. geek, person with third eye, vegetarian, animal lover; strict parent, social activist.\nThe readers. A total of 192 readers attended the first five human library sessions. 60% of them are females and 40% are males. 92% are first timers and 8% of them supported the program many times. After every session, our participants were asked to answer an evaluation form to which they were asked regarding their thoughts about the selection of available human books.\nReaders were asked regarding their thoughts about the selection of available human books. 53% said that the selected human books were very sufficient and appropriate. Readers were also asked about the most important learning experience they gained while reading the books. Here are some of their answers: ""I was able to learn something from the human book that can\'t be found on any other printed [materials] in the bookstore and the library."" ""More enlightened on the subject.""\nMost of the readers expressed that they would still consider attending future sessions and that they will recommend the human library program to their peers and friends.\nYouTube as a video sharing tool. The Human Library committee decided to upload the videos via its institutional YouTube account to document and reach out its human library program to a wider public. From October 2016 to January 2017, a total of 29 videos were uploaded. Session six had the most number of videos uploaded due to the increase of video cameras used during the event.\n(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz3D8L0uJ_UUEp-qHzG6SZhWVLkY-YDaK).\nThe five most viewed videos out of the 29 published human library reading sessions in YouTube were as follows: ""Meryenda\'s not enough: moving beyond personality based politics by Vico Sotto""from Human Library session four with 765 views; ""Bisexual by Ms. Ana Alexandra Castro"" from Human Library session six with 219 views; while ""Of Laces and Runways by ThonieSabile"" from Human Library session five got total views of 214; ""Olympian by Ms. Ian Lariba"" from Human Library session six got total views of 168; lastly, ""The green archer\'s game by Jeron Alvin Teng (student athlete)"" from Human Library session three received 119 views. The most shared video was ""Returning Filipinos by IreeneLeoncio"" from Human Library five which received five shares and the video that acquired the most number of likes among the viewers was ""Meryenda\'s not enough: moving beyond personality based politics by Vico Sotto"""" from Human Library session four with 10 likes.\nBased from this data, political personalities such as Mr. Vico Sotto had a strong impact on the viewers. Even during the actual reading sessions, a lot of readers showed-up to listen to his story. Sensitive issues such as sexuality and gender are also a notable topic for the Human Library readers. It shows that reader\'s interests and curiosity are into timely and familiar topics where they can relate themselves. Videos as sources of information can be influential to those who are watching them. It is hoped that by sharing the Human Library program to the wider public, most of the citizens become more understanding and tolerant individuals. \nCONCLUSION\nIn the midst of continued abundance in media and information sources, libraries and information professionals have a significant role to play. Our programs move ahead with socially relevant content, as our roles continue to conform to the changes in our society.\nWith the aid of an online video sharing tool, the means to distribute a socially-relevant and multi-culturally diverse program that is funded and taken-over by a library in an organized and fast manner will help us ensure that we reach our target market. Libraries serve not only to the confines of its bona fide members but try to cross the border and close the gap in making sure that all the potential learners will be able to have access to the most important collection and resources that are available. The library is an instrument to provide means to the underserved albeit there is really a need for the help of other stakeholders to provide other means such as free internet or available physical space to connect and have access to library resources.\nAs an information provider, it is the role of the libraries to give accurate and meaningful information through educating and guiding the community in becoming media and information literate. As a knowledge space, what we can do is to help the community to be aware and be more open minded towards our differences and accept cultural diversity. The human library program is a way to have dialogue and encourage people to be more tolerant in understanding others. It promotes social cohesion, peace and interreligious dialogue that help us grow as people of the world; it reminds us to be human and humane to others. And with the ongoing technological trend we have, the library can only hope that all information may be accessed free online.",4291,4837

The De La Salle University (DLSU) Libraries organised the first Human Library in the Philippines in August 2014. The initial target audience were undergraduate and graduate students of the University. In 2016, the Integrated School Libraries organised Human Library sessions for grade school, junior high school, and senior high school students. The activity allowed them to engage with human books actively, facilitating an innovative learning experience. This paper describes the Human Library program of the DLSU Integrated School Libraries. The program aims to promote respectful dialogue between human books and students, foster the culture of diversity and difference, and reduce prejudice and discrimination against people with different social and cultural backgrounds. The program has been integrated with the school curriculum, thus allowing students to have the opportunity to dialogue with human books from different backgrounds, such as people with a tattoo, members of LGBTQ community, people with mental health issues, people with bipolar disorder, and people with eating disorders among others. Through this learning experience, students are expected to appreciate diversity and are more openminded at an early age, be more accepting and kinder to others, empathetic, and respectful.

The idea of a modern library is not just limited to collections of reference materials, books that support school curriculum, general books not specific to any subject area, periodicals, newspaper, audiovisual materials, government publications, and electronic and online journals. These resources enable the library to serve its role in the community to provide information and support the success of the education of the communities they serve. Still, libraries are also service organisations and strive to instil social awareness and community involvement and serve other purposes like socioeconomic and political changes because they organise and make available the written history, culture, and knowledge of the human race (Patel, 2011). Implementing a Human Library program is just one of the ways that libraries can attain this purpose. This program can fulfil the educational role of the library to promote respectful dialogue and develop an individual's open outlook without any discrimination, stereotypes, and prejudice.
The Human Library in the Philippines
The Human Library was conceptualised in Copenhagen in 2000 by Ronni Abergel, his brother Danny, and colleagues Asma Mouna and Christoffer Erichsen (The Human Library Organization, 2019). This project is a global innovative, hands-on learning platform where real people are on loan to readers. It is a learning platform where personal dialogues challenge stigma and stereotypes and create a safe space for dialogue. The concept of the project employs the traditional role of a regular library where users can request a specific book of their choice. In the human library concept, members of the minority volunteer and play the role of 'human book' and are 'borrowed' for conversations. Throughout the session, they share their personal histories and experiences. 'Readers', in turn, asks questions that the human book can answer provided that the living books are comfortable in answering it and does not offend him/her in any way (Groyecka et al., 2019). There are two types of Human Libraries, open and dedicated ones. A dedicated library is organised for members of a specific group like students, while sessions done in public libraries is free for everybody who would like to participate in it (Abergel, 2005).
Today, the Human Library hosts events at libraries, festivals, conferences, public schools, high schools, higher learning institutions for the public and private sectors. The Human Library Organisation has rich experience of 19 years. The organisers of the Human Library are scattered in 80 countries, six continents. In Asia, Human Library events are already being organised in Korea, Thailand, China, Hong Kong, India, and Malaysia. The first-ever Human Library event organised in the Philippines was launched by the De La Salle University (DLSU) Libraries on 14 August 2014 (De La Salle University Libraries, 2014).
The idea of organising the event started in January 2014 when DLSU Libraries received an invitation from the Rajamangala University of Technology Isan in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, to attend the 2014 International Forum on Human Library Development for ASEAN++. The forum, which was attended by the Director of Libraries, helped provide a better understanding of the concept. It also offered ideas on how the concept can be adopted in the DLSU Libraries.
In August 2019, the DLSU Libraries celebrated the fifth-year anniversary of the program. As part of the DLSU Libraries' aim to cultivate an image of a sensible and sensitive community of Lasallians towards social issues, this activity is an alternative way of learning, which may promote dialogue, reduce prejudice, and encourage understanding of people from different walks of life.
During the launching year in 2014, 10 human books representing different types of prejudices served as living books and were tagged as (1) The DLSU Libraries held Human Library sessions regularly every three months, every term. Human books are only available on specific set dates, usually one full day for the Integrated School Libraries in the Laguna Campus and half-day at the Learning Commons-Manila Campus. The sessions start with an opening ceremony, followed by orientations for human books and readers. During the orientation, organisers discuss the expectations of readers and human books. Human books are expected to be truthful in sharing their stories. The focus of the conversations and questions should be on the identified prejudice, stereotype, or topic. Books and readers are always expected to keep decorum. Human books must wear the Human Library t-shirt provided by the organisers during the session.
Sessions are usually informal and come in the form of conversation or dialogue between the living book and the reader. The DLSU Libraries follow the 'group reading' type of session where three to four people get to 'read' one book simultaneously. Living books are individually stationed inside discussion rooms, and the readers get to choose the book they would want to 'read' by going inside the room of the preferred human book. For the sessions held in the Integrated School, human books are stationed inside the classrooms.
Since 2014, in the Manila Campus, the DLSU Libraries organised nine sessions wherein 84 human books were invited and willingly volunteered to share their personal stories. A total of 1,712 readers, consisting of college students, graduate students, teachers, school administrators, and non-DLSU members from different schools participated. A total of 55 unique prejudices, stereotypes, and discrimination topics were covered. The average numbers of readers per reading session are 4-6, and the average duration of one reading session lasts for 45 minutes. The program is supported by university partners, which include the DLSU College of Law, DLSU Archers Network (student organisation), DLSU Green Giant FM Radio, Chinese Corner, American Corner-Manila, and Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP).
In January 2017, the Philippine Association of Academic and Research Librarians (PAARL), Inc. conferred its 'Outstanding Library Program of the Year Award' to the De La Salle University Libraries' Human Library Program. The award is given to an academic or research library in recognition of its outstanding library program that contributes to Philippine academic librarianship and library development in the Philippines. DLSU's Human Library was commended as 'an innovative ongoing outreach program' for its strong impact on the library community, innovation, and sustainability that it may be replicated in other library communities or institutions.
To promote the Human Library, before the scheduled sessions, announcements were published in some major daily newspapers in the Philippines. There were also written news and feature articles about the Human Library in DLSU student publications and coverage in the university FM radio station, Green Giant.
after attending the sessions to understand the impact of the Human Library in their lives as learners. This paper aims to recognise the challenges and opportunities of the Human Library in promoting diversity, inclusion, and equity in the school environment.
Research Problems
(1) What are the personal experiences of human books and readers during human library sessions? (2) What are the challenges and opportunities of the Human Library in promoting diversity, inclusion, and equity in the school environment?
Literature Review
There are Human Library research studies conducted worldwide since its inception in 2000. Most of the studies explore the effectiveness of the Human Library project on the full effect of decreasing prejudice and stereotypes among the readers of the living books. Dobreski and Huang (2016), for instance, cited the eight benefits from Human Library sessions, namely: helping others, teaching, making connections, learning, self-expression, reflection, therapeutic benefits, and personal enjoyment. Inkster et al. (2016), in their study of the Human Library in Bolton, found the activity successful in its aim to challenge prejudice in healthcare, for hearing stories of discrimination make them more understanding of patient's natural fear which could be heightened by past personal experience of prejudice. Groyecka et al. (2019) conducted a pre-post intervention study that examined the effectiveness of the Human Library in Wroclaw, Poland, in reducing the social stigma towards particular prejudices -Roma, Muslims, dark-skinned and transgender people, as well as in decreasing homonegativity. In this paper, they also measured whether participation in the Human Library changes individual attitudes towards diverse workgroups. Their findings show that the Human Library decreased social prejudice towards Muslims. They likewise observed an increase in positive affective attitude towards working in diversified groups.
A study by Orosz, Bánki, Bőthe, Tóth-Király, and Tropp (2016) researched whether Hungarian teenagers taking part in the Human Library intervention changed their attitudes towards Roma and LGBT people. The study revealed a significant difference in perceived prejudice towards both groups. The event was dedicated solely to high school students and was not open to the general public. The groups towards which the shift in attitudes was tested are somewhat limited, considering the problems with discrimination that the many minorities in Eastern Europe struggle with.
In the Philippines, several studies were done by librarians from DLSU. Yap and Labangon (2015) discussed in their paper in their paper that the human library proved to be an alternative way of learning for both the reader and the human book. The sessions create a liberating moment for both parties as they share their experiences. It empowers people to accept the differences among individuals. Yap, Labangon, and Cajes (2017) present the role of libraries in promoting dialogue to reduce discrimination, share how libraries document human library sessions as a form of oral history, and provide information on the effect of human library sessions to readers.
Their paper documented the DLSU human library program as an alternative source of information that promotes cultural diversity to improve many facets of literacies, which include media and information literacy.
The study reported in this paper describes the Human Library program of the DLSU Integrated School Libraries, based on the research questions about the experience of the participants themselves, and their perceptions of any benefits to them.
Research Design
This paper is a descriptive study where data were collected before and after eight Human Library sessions at the Integrated School in DLSU Laguna Campus. The authors analysed the students' learning experiences after attending the Human Library session based on the completed evaluation forms (see Appendices 1 and 2). A total of 973 readers and 26 human books participated in the evaluation. Data were collected from SY2016-2017 to SY2018-2019. The authors used Microsoft Excel to process the data. NVivo was also used to analyse the sentiments of students' qualitative comments in response to the open questions.
Research Findings

The Human Library and the DLSU Integrated School
The Human Library at DLSU Integrated School aims to challenge stereotypes, stigma, prejudice, and discrimination that grade and high school students have formed about a person (subject) and that in the end, these are reduced, if not eradicated. Likewise, it aims to foster an understanding of people of what they are or what they do. While the Human Library's objectives can be flexible in responding to localised contexts, DLSU opted to stick to its original objectives. However, in the future, the organisers may consider realigning the concept to support the programs and services of the University. The Integrated School Libraries at the DLSU Laguna Campus hosted the seventh session of the Human Library on 3 March 2017, from 8:00 am-11:00 am. This session covered human books on the following subjects: Martial Law victim, LGBT representative, Catholic layperson, tattoo artist, person with ADHD, professional squatter, jobless person, person with tattoo, human rights activist, and reformed drug addict.
This specific session targeted Grade 10 and Grade 11 students. What sets this session apart is that it was held in the classrooms with 25 or more readers per human book. Separate sessions were given to each grade level. The teacher advisers introduced the human books to the class. At the end of each session, the students should be able to: (1) demonstrate an understanding of people's diverse socio-cultural background; (2) describe the different prejudices, stereotypes, and discriminations faced by marginalised and underserved groups of the society; and (3) recognise various strategies to break stereotypes, eliminate prejudice, and stop discrimination in the school.
Table 1 shows that since 2017 the Integrated School Libraries organised eight sessions wherein 42 human books were invited and willingly volunteered to share their personal stories. A total of 2,275 readers consisting of Grade 5, 6, 10, and senior high school students, teachers, school administrators, and non-DLSU members from different schools participated.
The number of sessions, human books, and readers increased yearly. For SY2016-2017, there was one session recorded with seven human books and 533 readers composed of grade 10 and 11 students. In SY2017-2018, there were four sessions with 21 human books and 744 readers consisting of grades 5-6 and 10-12 students. In SY2018-2019, there were eight sessions with 14 human books and 998 readers composed of grades 6 and 10-12 students. As shown in Tables 234, the human book's topic varied depending on the audience or readers per grade level. Among the topics covered were victims of martial law, human rights activist (enforced disappearances), religious person, professional squatter (informal settlers), ex-drug addict, people with tattoos, person with bipolar disorder, LGBTQ person, unemployed person, and tattoo artist. In SY2017-2018 Human Library sessions, topics included non-sensitive topics intended for the grade 5-6 readers like the least favourite subject in school focusing on social science, art, mathematics, Catholic faith and Filipino. The focus of discussions with the grade 10-12 readers was based on person with psoriasis, person with bipolar disorder, a young businessperson, son of a teenage single mom, a cancer patient, and a Muslim person.  In SY2018-2019, for grade 6 readers, the topics discussed were soldier, police, and religious representatives. In contrast, topics of human books for grades 10-12 readers are millionaire (since birth or rags-to-riches), martial law, bipolar, adopted child, working student, ex-convict, artist, broken family, overweight/obese, disabilities, mental disorders, gender preference, person with HIV and women in male-dominated professions.
Human Books and Lasallian Students Experience
Organisers distributed evaluation forms to readers and human books after each session from 2016 to 2019 (see Annexe 1 and 2). The instruments used a combination of closed and open-ended questions. The questions included in the tools are statements about the Human Library session, their previous and future participation of readers and human books, challenging experiences as a human book, and the most memorable experience of the readers.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of human readers by age. The majority of the readers are 16 years old. The age of human readers ranges from 9 to 19, with most readers in the age group 15-17. The highest number of readers in the sessions were composed of grades 10-11 students. Thirty-nine per cent of the participants have already participated in the Human Library events before. Most of them are grade 11 (Figure 2); 61% of the respondents have not participated in other human library events previously as shown in Figure 3. When talking about the readers' experience of the Human Library sessions, Figure 4 shows that in general, many respondents have a positive attitude towards diversity of prejudices stereotypes, and topics that are available to them. The organisers chose the topics of prejudices and stereotypes based on the survey conducted to determine students' interests.
In terms of the helpfulness of the organisers, many of the respondents showed a favourable agreement to the statement in Figure 5. The librarians and support staff at the Laguna Campus are the main organisers of the Human Library sessions, in close coordination with the school's subject coordinators and teachers. Figure 6 shows that most of the respondents strongly agreed that the time allocated for the reading session was sufficient, while 35 respondents disagreed, and 14 strongly disagree with this statement. The entire reading session is about 45 minutes. In the Manila Campus, each reader can read a book for 15 minutes, so in one Human Library session, they can read three books. In the Integrated School sessions, students are only allowed to pick one human book to read. Reservations are made a day before the actual session.
When it comes to the impact of the sessions, Figure 7 shows that almost 50% of the total respondents strongly agree with the statement, 'the reading session helped my prejudice on the topic'. In comparison, 10% of them are neutral or have no opinion. Only 16 students showed contrary agreement with the statement. The data  show that there is a positive impact on the prejudices of grade school and high school students.
In terms of the overall rating of the sessions conducted, 64% of the respondents gave an excellent rating of their Human Library experience, as illustrated in Figure 8. When the respondents were asked if they still have other prejudices that they want the organisers to consider in the next Human Library sessions, 75% of them responded no, I do not have any.
Using the web-based Voyant Tools to generate a word cloud of the key terms found in the reflection of the students, we were able to determine the most-commonly occurring  words and themes in their comments. Figure 9 shows that learned, martial, people, and law are the most-commonly occurring themes.
Using the Nvivo software, Figure 10 shows that the difference between negative and positive sentiments in students' comments is not significantly high. However, positive views still are higher than those negative ones.
When it comes to the Human Books' own experience, they all agreed on having a pleasant experience volunteering as a human book (see Table 5). Note that only 26 human books are in this study. The Human Books said that the readers agreed that they actively participated during the reading session. The orientation provided by the  organisers on the role of the human book was beneficial. The organisers/librarians were very helpful. The duration of the reading hours was sufficient and that the reading session provided them with the opportunity to promote understanding between people of opposing views. Notice that several human books rated the statements 'the readers actively participated during the reading session' and 'the duration of the reading hours is sufficient' negatively.     The majority of Human Books agreed on having the willingness to participate again as a human book in the future. They likewise would recommend to their friends or others to participate in a human library event either as a reader or a living book, as shown in Figures 11 and12, respectively.
In the evaluation form, the human books wrote the following comments.
• Good to be more participative • Continue to promote HL • Awesome project They also shared some areas for improvement to make it more effective. They suggested giving ample time for the students to read them and listen to their stories, especially when readers are actively participating in the conversation. They hope to receive background information about human readers before the reading session so they could prepare to make the dialogue appropriate for their age level. Some of the human books had few readers. They suggested that the library should find ways to increase their readers.
When the human books shared the most challenging part of being a human book, they expressed the difficulty of sharing their personal experiences and relating it to a younger audience. They feared that the readers might ask sensitive questions or have unpleasant comments. Keeping the readers' interest, student engagement, and convincing the students proved to be another challenge as well as ensuring that readers understand the topics and concepts. They also experience feeling the pain of what they have been through when they are sharing past experiences. Another difficulty was classroom management and ensuring active listening for the big audience, especially for human books, with no experience dealing  with the younger student audiences. Human books also had difficulty eliciting questions from the readers because they are shy to ask questions. They also perceived that once the students ask questions, the time allotted was not enough to answer all the questions.
Issues and Challenges
There are specific issues and challenges that the organisers faced during the planning and implementation of the program. For every session, they have encountered different problems. One of their foremost difficulties was the limited topic of prejudices that are appropriate for younger readers. In the planning stage, the organisers did conduct surveys to check the interest of the students. The initial survey conducted showed that the students, at their age, already have prejudices on sensitive topics such as strippers, prostitutes, mistresses, drug addicts, and battered wives. Another challenge during the implementation stage is the need to strategise and enable the students to read more than one human book as well as to get them to participate and ask questions during the sessions.
When it comes to looking for human books, since the schedule must fit the program partners' availability, the organisers have difficulties in inviting possible human books due to changes and conflict in the schedule. The changes in the schedule lead to the shorter lead time for leg work and preparations. Another challenge for the organisers is the limited time given by the program partners for the sessions because of the possibility of class disruption. The location of the school also proves to be a challenge to potential human books.
Conclusion
This paper focuses on four aspects: describe the human library program of the DLSU Integrated School Libraries, examine the experiences of human books and readers during human library sessions, analyse the personal reflections of the human books and students after attending the Human Library sessions, and recognise the challenges and opportunities of the Human Library in promoting diversity, inclusion, and equity in the school environment.
The program helped in drawing awareness and promoting respectful dialogue, diversity, and empathy among grade and high school students as it resulted in reducing prejudices among the student readers after the session. The purpose of Human Library sessions was achieved, as Human Books related having had a wonderful experience volunteering as a human book. The readers have actively participated during the reading session and that the reading session provided them with the opportunity to promote understanding between people of opposing views.
The program will continue in the following years, but changes will be made based on the results of this study. The number of readers per human book will be less. The organisers will explore the possibility of offering human library sessions to lower grade levels (Grades 3-4, Grade 7-8) to focus on building a culture of diversity, openness, and empathy among grade school and high school students.
